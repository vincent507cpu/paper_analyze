    "query": "What are some potential applications of ferromagnetic semiconductors?",
    "gold_answer": "Spin injection into non magnetic semiconductors, or electrical manipulation of carrier induced magnetism in magnetic semiconductors.",
    "predict": "Some potential applications of ferromagnetic semiconductors include:\n- Spin injection into non-magnetic semiconductors\n- Electrical manipulation of carrier-induced magnetism in magnetic semiconductors\n- Development of nanodevices such as memory nanodots and nanochannels for spin injection\n- Potential utilization of narrow graphene nanoribbons and graphene nanomesh lattices for applications requiring precise control over lattice geometry and edge disorder.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists two specific applications of ferromagnetic semiconductors, while Answer B provides a more extensive list that includes the same two applications as well as additional ones. Although both answers mention spin injection and electrical manipulation, Answer B expands on the potential applications, making it more comprehensive. However, the core applications mentioned in both answers are the same, indicating that they are semantically equivalent in terms of the applications they highlight, despite the difference in detail."
