    "gold_answer": "Byte-Pair Encoding perplexity  (BPE PPL),\nBLEU-1,\nBLEU-4,\nROUGE-L,\npercentage of distinct unigram (D-1),\npercentage of distinct bigrams(D-2),\nuser matching accuracy(UMA),\nMean Reciprocal Rank(MRR)\nPairwise preference over baseline(PP)BLEU-1/4 and ROUGE-L, likelihood of generated recipes using identical input specifications but conditioned on ten different user profiles, user matching accuracy (UMA), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), neural scoring model from BIBREF33 to measure recipe-level coherence Distinct-1/2, UMA = User Matching Accuracy, MRR\n= Mean Reciprocal Rank, PP = Pairwise preference over baseline (evaluated for 310 recipe pairs per model)",
    "predict": "BLEU score, contrastive evaluation of translation of several discourse phenomena, human evaluation.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists a comprehensive set of specific metrics used for evaluation, including various scoring methods and their definitions, while Answer B provides a more general overview of evaluation methods without specific metrics. The terms in Answer B, such as 'BLEU score' and 'human evaluation,' do not directly correspond to the detailed metrics in Answer A. Therefore, the two answers do not convey the same information regarding evaluation metrics, making them semantically non-equivalent."
