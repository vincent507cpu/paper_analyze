{"query": "What are the network's baseline features?", "gold_answer": " The features extracted from CNN.", "predict": "The network's baseline features outperform pre-trained features and are effective for sarcasm detection.", "consistency": "0", "reasoning": "Answer A states that the features are 'extracted from CNN,' which implies a specific source of the features but does not provide any information about their performance or effectiveness. Answer B, on the other hand, describes the network's baseline features in terms of their performance, specifically stating that they 'outperform pre-trained features' and are 'effective for sarcasm detection.' Since Answer A does not address performance or effectiveness, and Answer B provides additional context that is not present in Answer A, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."}
