    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific details about the tasks, naming them explicitly as 'Quora Duplicate Question Pair Detection' and 'Ranking questions in Bing's People Also Ask.' Answer B, however, only refers to them in a general manner as 'Tasks 1 and Task 2' without specifying what those tasks are.
