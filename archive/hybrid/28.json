    "query": "What is the main advantage of the proposed method in terms of computation time?",
    "gold_answer": "The time required to update the belief does not increase with the complexity of the environment.",
    "predict": "The main advantage of the proposed method in terms of computation time is that it significantly reduces computational efficiency compared to traditional numerical methods like Runge-Kutta and convolution. The proposed method achieves faster execution times by obtaining an explicit response solution directly at a specific time, rather than requiring integration over a larger range for approximate solutions. This results in substantial improvements in the speed of computation.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A focuses on the specific advantage that the time required to update the belief remains constant regardless of environmental complexity. In contrast, Answer B discusses a broader range of advantages, including significant reductions in computational efficiency and faster execution times compared to traditional methods. While both answers address computation time, they highlight different aspects and do not convey the same core advantage. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
