    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific sentence embedding methods such as GloVe, BERT, Universal Sentence Encoder, and others, directly addressing the query about which methods are evaluated. In contrast, Answer B discusses the evaluation process using SentEval transfer tasks but does not provide any specific methods. Since Answer B does not answer the question about which methods are evaluated, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
