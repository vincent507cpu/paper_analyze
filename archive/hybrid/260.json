(2015), and we also use behavioral data (eye-tracking data and self-paced reading times) from Frank et al. (2013) which were collected on the same set of 205 sentences.\nSelect:\n- ERP data collected and computed by Frank et al.

    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A specifies the datasets used in a particular study, focusing on ERP and behavioral data from specific references. Answer B, however, lists entirely different datasets related to Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, which are not mentioned in Answer A. Since the datasets referenced in both answers pertain to different studies and contexts, they are not semantically equivalent."
