    "query": "What are the three regularization terms?",
    "gold_answer": "a regularization term associated with neutral features, the maximum entropy of class distribution regularization term, the KL divergence between reference and predicted class distributiona regularization term associated with neutral features,  the maximum entropy of class distribution, KL divergence between reference and predicted class distribution",
    "predict": "The three regularization terms are:\n1. A regularization term associated with neutral features.\n2. The maximum entropy of class distribution regularization term.\n3. The KL divergence between reference and predicted class distribution.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists the three regularization terms in a continuous format without clear separation, while Answer B presents them in a structured, enumerated format. Despite the difference in presentation, both answers convey the same three regularization terms: a term for neutral features, maximum entropy of class distribution, and KL divergence. Therefore, they are semantically equivalent as they refer to the same concepts."
