    "query": "What may happen if the VR headset lenses are exposed to sunlight or strong light?",
    "gold_answer": "Exposure to sunlight or strong light may cause permanent yellow spot damage on the screen.",
    "predict": "Exposure to direct sunlight may cause permanent yellow spot damage on the screen.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A mentions 'sunlight or strong light' as potential causes for damage, while Answer B specifies 'direct sunlight.'
