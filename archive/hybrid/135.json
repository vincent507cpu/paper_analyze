    "query": "How does their model improve interpretability compared to softmax transformers?",
    "gold_answer": "the attention heads in the proposed adaptively sparse Transformer can specialize more and with higher confidenceWe introduce sparse attention into the Transformer architecture",
    "predict": "Their model improves interpretability by incorporating sparse attention mechanisms instead of the traditional softmax transformer. Sparse attention allows for zero probabilities in irrelevant words and can prune redundant head attention heads to reduce redundancy, enhancing interpretability while slightly improving performance.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A mentions that the proposed adaptively sparse Transformer allows attention heads to specialize more and introduces sparse attention into the architecture, but it lacks detail on how this specifically improves interpretability. Answer B explicitly states that the model improves interpretability by incorporating sparse attention mechanisms, explaining how it allows for zero probabilities in irrelevant words and prunes redundant attention heads. While both answers discuss sparse attention, Answer B provides a clearer and more comprehensive explanation of how this leads to improved interpretability, making them not semantically equivalent in terms of clarity and completeness."
