{"query": "What is the invertibility condition?", "gold_answer": "The neural projector must be invertible.we constrain our neural projector with two requirements: (1) INLINEFORM0 and (2) INLINEFORM1 exists", "predict": "The invertibility condition ensures the Jacobian determinant of the transformation is always equal to one, which guarantees volume preservation and natural satisfaction.", "consistency": "0", "reasoning": "Answer A states that the neural projector must be invertible and mentions specific requirements for this invertibility. Answer B, on the other hand, describes the invertibility condition in terms of the Jacobian determinant and its implications for volume preservation. While both answers relate to the concept of invertibility, they focus on different aspects: Answer A emphasizes the requirements for a specific neural projector, while Answer B discusses a mathematical property related to invertibility. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent as they address different facets of the invertibility condition."}
