    "reasoning": "Answer A refers to the datasets used in a previous reference (BIBREF7) but does not provide specific information about the datasets themselves. Answer B, on the other hand, explicitly states that the dataset is described and available at a specific link, providing more detailed information. Since Answer A does not clarify what the datasets are, while Answer B does, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
