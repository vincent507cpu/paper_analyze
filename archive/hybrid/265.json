{"query": "How are weights dynamically adjusted?", "gold_answer": "One can think $(1-p_{i1})$ as a weight associated with each example, which changes as training proceeds. The intuition of changing $p_{i1}$ to $(1-p_{i1}) p_{i1}$ is to push down the weight of easy examples. For easy examples whose probability are approaching 0 or 1, $(1-p_{i1}) p_{i1}$ makes the model attach significantly less focus to them. Figure FIGREF23 gives gives an explanation from the perspective in derivative: the derivative of $\\frac{(1-p)p}{1+(1-p)p}$ with respect to $p$ approaches 0 immediately after $p$ approaches 0, which means the model attends less to examples once they are correctly classified.associates each training example with a weight in proportion to $(1-p)$, and this weight dynamically changes as training proceeds", "predict": "Weights are dynamically adjusted based on various techniques such as focal loss, self-paced learning, and meta-networks.", "consistency": "0", "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed explanation of how weights are adjusted during training, specifically focusing on the relationship between the probability of examples and their associated weights. It emphasizes the mechanism of reducing focus on easy examples. In contrast, Answer B mentions general techniques for dynamic weight adjustment without providing specific details about the underlying mechanisms. Since Answer A and Answer B describe different approaches and levels of detail regarding weight adjustment, they are not semantically equivalent."}
