{"query": "What architecture does the decoder have?", "gold_answer": "LSTMLSTM", "predict": "The decoder has a text encoder-decoder architecture similar to MT models.", "consistency": "0", "reasoning": "Answer A specifies 'LSTMLSTM' as the architecture of the decoder, indicating a specific type of recurrent neural network architecture. Answer B describes the decoder as having a 'text encoder-decoder architecture similar to MT models,' which suggests a broader category of architectures that may include LSTM but does not explicitly state it. Since Answer A provides a specific architecture while Answer B describes a general type of architecture, they are not semantically equivalent."}
