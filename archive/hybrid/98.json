    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a concise representation of the rationality coefficient as 'γh,' while Answer B elaborates by stating, 'The rationality coefficient used in the observation model is γ h.' Despite the difference in length and phrasing, both answers refer to the same coefficient, γh, making them semantically equivalent in the context of the query."
