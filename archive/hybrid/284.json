    "query": "How is the political bias of different sources included in the model?",
    "gold_answer": "By assigning a political bias label to each news article and training only on left-biased or right-biased outlets of both disinformation and mainstream domainswe also account for political biases inherent to different news sources, referring to the procedure proposed in BIBREF2 to label different outlets. Overall we show that we are able to classify credible vs non-credible diffusion networks (and consequently news articles) with high accuracy (AUROC up to 94%), even when accounting for the political bias of sources (and training only on left-biased or right-biased articles). We observe that the layer of mentions alone conveys useful information for the classification, denoting a different usage of this functionality when sharing news belonging to the two news domains. We also show that most discriminative features, which are relative to the breadth and depth of largest cascades in different layers, are the same across the two countries.",
    "predict": "The political bias of different sources is included by learning parameters for \"INLINEFORM0\" and \"INLINEFORM1.\" The model uses the layer of mentions to convey useful information for classification. To assess robustness, experiments were conducted using only left-biased or right-biased outlets from both disinformation and mainstream domains. Results show significant accuracy in distinguishing mainstream news from disinformation regardless of political bias.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed explanation of how political bias is incorporated into the model, mentioning the assignment of political bias labels to news articles and the training on specific biased outlets. It emphasizes the classification accuracy and the role of mentions in conveying information. Answer B, while also discussing the inclusion of political bias, focuses on learning parameters and the use of mentions for classification, but lacks the depth of detail regarding the training process and accuracy metrics. Although both answers address the inclusion of political bias, they do so in different ways and with varying levels of detail, leading to the conclusion that they are not semantically equivalent."
