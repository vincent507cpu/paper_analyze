    "query": "How do the authors evidence the claim that many engineers find it a big overhead to choose from multiple frameworks, models and optimization techniques?",
    "gold_answer": "By conducting a survey among engineersUnanswerable",
    "predict": "The authors evidence this claim by showing that when M > 2 (multiple frameworks/models/optimization techniques), the optimization process often yields denoisers with different γ values (sampling overhead) depending on α distributions. This variability suggests challenges for productivity and optimal solutions in engineer usage, which is directly related to why many engineers find it a big overhead to choose from multiple frameworks, models, and optimization techniques.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the authors evidence the claim by conducting a survey among engineers, but it does not provide any specific details or results from that survey. In contrast, Answer B provides a detailed explanation of how the authors support their claim through empirical observations related to the optimization process and its implications for engineers. Since Answer A is vague and lacks substantive evidence, while Answer B offers a comprehensive analysis, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
