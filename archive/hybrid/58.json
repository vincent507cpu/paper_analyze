    "query": "How does the receptive field size affect the completion of shapes?",
    "gold_answer": "Bigger receptive field size leads to more successful shape completion.",
    "predict": "The bigger the receptive field size, the more complete shapes can be reconstructed using DSP.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that a bigger receptive field size leads to more successful shape completion, implying a positive correlation between receptive field size and the ability to complete shapes. Answer B elaborates that a larger receptive field size allows for more complete shapes to be reconstructed, specifically mentioning DSP (Digital Signal Processing). Both answers convey the same underlying idea that an increase in receptive field size enhances the ability to complete or reconstruct shapes, making them semantically equivalent despite the different wording and additional context in Answer B."
