    "predict": "The 12 languages covered in the content are: French, German, Dutch, Russian, Spanish, Italian, Turkish, Persian, Swedish, Mongolian, and Chinese.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists 12 languages, including Chinese Mandarin, Welsh, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Kiswahili, and Yue Chinese. Answer B, however, lists a different set of languages: French, German, Dutch, Russian, Spanish, Italian, Turkish, Persian, Swedish, Mongolian, and Chinese. Since the languages mentioned in both answers do not match, they are not semantically equivalent for the query regarding the 12 languages covered."
