    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific numerical values for the sizes of the training and test datasets, although it is somewhat convoluted and includes additional information that may not be directly relevant. Answer B, on the other hand, states that the sizes of both datasets are not explicitly stated and suggests referring to a table for the information. Since Answer A gives specific sizes while Answer B indicates that the sizes are not provided, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
