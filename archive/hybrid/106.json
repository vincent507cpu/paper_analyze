    "query": "What is the potential of SNNs in modeling the visual system?",
    "gold_answer": "SNNs have the potential to better model and explain the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system.",
    "predict": "The potential of SNNs (Simple Spiking Neural Networks) lies in their ability to model the hierarchical and functional properties observed in both macaques and mice's visual systems. This includes understanding how these animals process incomplete outlines into complete shapes and organize disconnected visual features, tasks that are crucial for visual processing.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A discusses the potential of SNNs in modeling the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system in a general sense. Answer B elaborates on this potential by specifying that SNNs can model hierarchical and functional properties observed in the visual systems of macaques and mice, and it provides examples of specific tasks related to visual processing. While both answers address the potential of SNNs in modeling the visual system, Answer B provides more detail and context. However, the core idea of modeling the visual system remains consistent between the two answers, making them semantically equivalent in terms of the overall concept."
