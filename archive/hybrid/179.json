    "query": "Which basic neural architecture perform best by itself?",
    "gold_answer": "BERT",
    "predict": "The basic neural architecture that performs best by itself is the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A identifies 'BERT' as the best-performing basic neural architecture by itself. In contrast, Answer B claims that the 'sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model' is the best. Since BERT and seq2seq are different architectures with distinct characteristics and performance metrics, the two answers cannot be considered semantically equivalent as they provide conflicting information regarding which architecture performs best."
