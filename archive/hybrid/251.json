    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A specifies 'DTA18, DTA19Diachronic Usage Relatedness (DURel) gold standard data set' as the corpus used for the task, which is a specific dataset. Answer B describes the corpus in more general terms, mentioning it as a 'freely available lemmatized, POS-tagged and spelling-normalized diachronic corpus of German texts from the 16th to the 20th century.' While both answers refer to a corpus related to diachronic studies, Answer A provides a specific name, whereas Answer B gives a broader description without naming the specific dataset. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
