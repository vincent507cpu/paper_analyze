    "query": "what previous RNN models do they compare with?",
    "gold_answer": "Variational LSTM, CharCNN, Pointer Sentinel-LSTM, RHN, NAS Cell, SRU, QRNN, RAN, 4-layer skip-connection LSTM, AWD-LSTM, Quantized LSTM",
    "predict": "They compare their method with RNN-based models like LSTM and Transformer. Specifically, they contrast it with previous RNN models in terms of performance on the new dataset built for experiments.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a specific list of previous RNN models that are compared, while Answer B gives a general overview of the comparison, mentioning LSTM and Transformer as examples and focusing on performance aspects. The two answers do not convey the same information; Answer A is more detailed and specific, whereas Answer B is broader and less precise. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
