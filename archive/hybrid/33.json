    "gold_answer": "There are 14,520 attendees, including 7,152 chemical scientists, 5,059 students, 1,283 exhibitors, 119 precollege teachers, 573 exposition visitors, and 453 guests.",
    "predict": "14,520 attendees.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed breakdown of the 14,520 attendees at the ACS national meeting, specifying the different categories of attendees. Answer B simply states the total number of attendees without any additional details. However, both answers convey the same total number of attendees, making them semantically equivalent in the context of the query, which asks for the total attendance figure."
