    "gold_answer": "YesNo",
    "predict": "No.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'YesNo,' which is ambiguous and does not clearly indicate a definitive answer. Answer B states 'No,' which clearly indicates that they do not employ their indexing-based method. Since Answer A does not provide a clear affirmative or negative response and Answer B explicitly states 'No,' the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
