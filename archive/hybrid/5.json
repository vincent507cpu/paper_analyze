    "query": "What was Hugh H. Goodwin's rank in the United States Navy?",
    "gold_answer": "Vice Admiral.",
    "predict": "Commander",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that Hugh H. Goodwin held the rank of 'Vice Admiral,' which is a high-ranking officer position in the Navy. Answer B states 'Commander,' which is a significantly lower rank compared to Vice Admiral. Since the two ranks are not equivalent and represent different levels of authority and responsibility within the Navy, the answers are not semantically equivalent."
