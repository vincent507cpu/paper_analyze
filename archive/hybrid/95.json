    "query": "What is the effect of accounting for path preference on the robot's belief update?",
    "gold_answer": "The belief entropy decreases more steadily.",
    "predict": "Accounting for path preference improves the robot's belief update by reducing over-confidence in predicting the goal likelihood, making it easier to reach the correct goal.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the belief entropy decreases more steadily, which implies a more consistent and reliable belief update process. Answer B elaborates on the improvement in the belief update by mentioning a reduction in over-confidence and an easier path to the correct goal. While both answers relate to the improvement of the robot's belief update, Answer A focuses on the steadiness of entropy, whereas Answer B discusses the reduction of over-confidence and the ease of reaching the goal. The two answers highlight different aspects of the effect, but they do not convey the same meaning, making them not semantically equivalent."
