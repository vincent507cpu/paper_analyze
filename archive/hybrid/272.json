    "query": "Is the data de-identified?",
    "gold_answer": "YesYes",
    "predict": "No. The data has been de-identified by removing identifying information such as \"de-\" tags and digital zeros, ensuring it cannot be traced back to its original source.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'YesYes,' which appears to be a typographical error or a repetition of 'yes,' indicating affirmation that the data is de-identified. Answer B, however, provides a detailed explanation that the data has not only been de-identified but also describes the process of de-identification, ultimately concluding that the data is not de-identified. Since Answer A affirms de-identification while Answer B denies it, the two answers are clearly not semantically equivalent."
