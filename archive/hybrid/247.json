    "query": "Do they report results only on English data?",
    "gold_answer": "YesUnanswerable",
    "predict": "No, they report results on English data only.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'YesUnanswerable,' which suggests that the question cannot be answered definitively, implying uncertainty about whether results are reported only on English data. Answer B, however, clearly states 'No, they report results on English data only,' indicating that results are indeed reported solely on English data. Since Answer A implies a lack of clarity while Answer B provides a definitive answer, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
