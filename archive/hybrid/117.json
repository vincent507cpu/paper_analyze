    "predict": "Additional features and context proposed: Incorporating KL divergence in certain algorithms like GE-FL provides better results for unbalanced datasets compared to maximum entropy and neutral features. The method also leverages feedback from instances and features used interlacedly. Additionally, a hierarchical approach using local features is proposed for more effective learning of context.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A suggests using tweets that one has replied to or quoted as contextual information, focusing on a specific type of contextual data. Answer B, however, discusses a broader range of additional features and methods, including KL divergence, feedback mechanisms, and hierarchical approaches for learning context. The two answers address different aspects of the query, with Answer A being more specific and limited in scope compared to the comprehensive nature of Answer B. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
