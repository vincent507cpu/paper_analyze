    "query": "What background do they have?",
    "gold_answer": "Unanswerable",
    "predict": "The text does not provide specific details about what backgrounds the individuals have.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'Unanswerable,' indicating that the question cannot be answered based on the available information. Answer B elaborates that 'the text does not provide specific details about what backgrounds the individuals have,' which implies that the information is indeed lacking. Both answers convey the same idea that the background information is not available, making them semantically equivalent."
