    "predict": "The three evaluation tasks used for evaluation are:\n1. Word analogy task\n2. Named entity recognition (NER) task",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific machine translation tasks involving language pairs, while Answer B describes entirely different evaluation tasks: word analogy and named entity recognition. Since the tasks mentioned in both answers are not the same and refer to different types of evaluations, they are not semantically equivalent."
