    "query": "What did the court in In re Ferguson conclude about the transformation prong of the Bilski test?",
    "gold_answer": "It required the transformation to be limited to specific data and a visual depiction representing specific objects or substances.",
    "predict": "The court in In re Ferguson focused on the intangibility of the compared data when evaluating the 'transformation' prong of the Bilski test. It concluded that there was no transformation without physical manifestation or machine involvement as determined by precedent such as Abele decision, which limited the requirements for patent eligibility under Section 101.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the court required the transformation to be limited to specific data and visual depictions of specific objects or substances. Answer B, however, emphasizes the court's focus on the intangibility of the data and the necessity of physical manifestation or machine involvement for a transformation to occur. While both answers discuss the transformation prong of the Bilski test, they highlight different aspects: Answer A is more about the specifics of data representation, while Answer B discusses the broader implications of transformation in relation to physicality and precedent. Therefore, the two answers are not semantically equivalent as they convey different interpretations of the court's conclusion."
