    "query": "How do they combine audio and text sequences in their RNN?",
    "gold_answer": "combines the information from these sources using a feed-forward neural modelencodes the information from audio and text sequences using dual RNNs and then combines the information from these sources using a feed-forward neural model",
    "predict": "The audio and text sequences are encoded separately using RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), combined using feed-forward neural models, and attention mechanisms focus on specific emotional parts of transcripts.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A describes the process of combining audio and text sequences using a feed-forward neural model and dual RNNs, while Answer B elaborates on the same process but includes additional details about attention mechanisms focusing on emotional parts of transcripts. Although both answers describe the encoding and combining of audio and text sequences, Answer B provides more specific information about the use of attention mechanisms, which is not mentioned in Answer A. Therefore, while they share a common process, the additional detail in Answer B makes it semantically richer but not equivalent in meaning to Answer A."
