    "query": "By how much does their model outperform the state of the art results?",
    "gold_answer": "the attention model, MDREA, also outperforms the best existing research results (WAP 0.690 to 0.688)",
    "predict": "1.88%",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a comparative performance metric between the attention model, MDREA, and the best existing research results, indicating a specific performance difference (0.690 vs. 0.688). However, it does not quantify the performance improvement in percentage terms. Answer B, on the other hand, states a specific percentage (1.88%) that indicates the model's performance improvement. Since Answer A does not directly provide the percentage improvement and Answer B does, they are not semantically equivalent."
