    "query": "What model did they use for their system?",
    "gold_answer": "AllWords model by counting the frequencies of all the remaining words and training a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier",
    "predict": "They used a DocRepair model for their system.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A describes the use of the AllWords model, which involves counting word frequencies and training a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. In contrast, Answer B states that a DocRepair model was used. Since the two answers refer to different models (AllWords vs. DocRepair), they are not semantically equivalent as they provide conflicting information regarding the model used for the system."
