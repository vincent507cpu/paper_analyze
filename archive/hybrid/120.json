    "gold_answer": "Answer with content missing: (Evaluation Metrics section) Precision, Recall, F1-scores, Strict match, METEOR, ROUGE-2",
    "predict": "Word analogy task and named entity recognition (NER) task.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists various evaluation metrics that are typically used to assess the performance of models in tasks such as natural language processing. In contrast, Answer B mentions specific tasks (word analogy and named entity recognition) that may be evaluated but does not address the type of evaluation metrics proposed for the task. Since Answer A focuses on metrics while Answer B focuses on tasks, they are not semantically equivalent."
