    "query": "which chinese datasets were used?",
    "gold_answer": "Answer with content missing: (Data section) Chinese with version 5.1 of the Chinese Penn Treebank (CTB)",
    "predict": "The Chinese datasets used in the experiment were MSRA and OntoNotes4.0.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A mentions the Chinese Penn Treebank (CTB) as a dataset, while Answer B lists MSRA and OntoNotes4.0 as the datasets used. Since both answers refer to different datasets and do not overlap in content, they are not semantically equivalent. The question asks for which datasets were used, and the answers provide different datasets, indicating a lack of equivalence."
