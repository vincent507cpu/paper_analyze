    "query": "Which baselines did they compare against?",
    "gold_answer": "Various tree structured neural networks including variants of Tree-LSTM, Tree-based CNN, RNTN, and non-tree models including variants of LSTMs, CNNs, residual, and self-attention based networksSentence classification baselines: RNTN (Socher et al. 2013), AdaMC-RNTN (Dong et al. 2014), TE-RNTN (Qian et al. 2015), TBCNN (Mou et al. 2015), Tree-LSTM (Tai, Socher, and Manning 2015), AdaHT-LSTM-CM (Liu, Qiu, and Huang 2017), DC-TreeLSTM (Liu, Qiu, and Huang 2017), TE-LSTM (Huang, Qian, and Zhu 2017), BiConTree (Teng and Zhang 2017), Gumbel Tree-LSTM (Choi, Yoo, and Lee 2018), TreeNet (Cheng et al. 2018), CNN (Kim 2014), AdaSent (Zhao, Lu, and Poupart 2015), LSTM-CNN (Zhou et al. 2016), byte-mLSTM (Radford, Jozefowicz, and Sutskever 2017), BCN + Char + CoVe (McCann et al. 2017), BCN + Char + ELMo (Peters et al. 2018). \nStanford Natural Language Inference baselines: Latent Syntax Tree-LSTM (Yogatama et al. 2017), Tree-based CNN (Mou et al. 2016), Gumbel Tree-LSTM (Choi, Yoo, and Lee 2018), NSE (Munkhdalai and Yu 2017), Reinforced Self- Attention Network (Shen et al. 2018), Residual stacked encoders: (Nie and Bansal 2017), BiLSTM with generalized pooling (Chen, Ling, and Zhu 2018).",
    "predict": "The baselines compared against were:\n- Majority class baseline\n- Neural Checklist Model adapted to use neural network (NN)\n- Simple Encoder-Decoder model with ingredient attention (Enc-Dec)",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed list of various tree-structured neural networks and other models used as baselines for comparison, specifically mentioning multiple specific models and their authors. In contrast, Answer B lists a few general models, including a majority class baseline and a simple encoder-decoder model. The two answers refer to different sets of baselines, with Answer A focusing on advanced neural network architectures and Answer B mentioning simpler models and a baseline. Therefore, the answers are not semantically equivalent as they refer to different comparisons."
