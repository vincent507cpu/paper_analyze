    "query": "How many layers does the UTCNN model have?",
    "gold_answer": "eight layers",
    "predict": "7",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the UTCNN model has 'eight layers,' while Answer B states it has '7 layers.' Since the two answers provide different numerical values for the number of layers, they are not semantically equivalent. The distinction between eight and seven is significant, as it directly answers the query about the total number of layers in the model."
