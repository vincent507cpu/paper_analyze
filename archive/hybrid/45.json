    "query": "What is the dynamical behavior of the anisotropic order parameter following a quench to the critical point?",
    "gold_answer": "It is well described by the Gaussian theory.",
    "predict": "The dynamical behavior of the anisotropic order parameter $m$ following a quench to the critical point is well described by FIG. 10 and other plots provided in the letter.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the dynamical behavior of the anisotropic order parameter is well described by the Gaussian theory, which is a theoretical framework. Answer B, however, specifies that the behavior is described by FIG. 10 and other plots, which are empirical representations rather than a theoretical description. While both answers address the dynamical behavior, they do so from different perspectives: one theoretical and one empirical. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
