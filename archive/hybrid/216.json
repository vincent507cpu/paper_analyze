    "predict": "The models used in the experiment are NMT (Neural Machine Translation) and SMT (Statistical Machine Translation).",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific models used in the experiment, including linear SVM, BiLSTM, and CNN, which are all machine learning models. In contrast, Answer B mentions NMT and SMT, which are different types of translation models. Since the models listed in Answer A do not match or relate to those in Answer B, they are not semantically equivalent."
