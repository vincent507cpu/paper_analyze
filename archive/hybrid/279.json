    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific NER tasks related to biomedical entities, while Answer B describes entirely different tasks that are not related to Named Entity Recognition. The tasks in Answer A are specific datasets used for evaluation, whereas Answer B mentions tasks that are more general and unrelated to the query about NER tasks. Therefore, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
