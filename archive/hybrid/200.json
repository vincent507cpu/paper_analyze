    "reasoning": "Answer A specifies the 'English-German dataset' as the dataset on which the approach achieves state-of-the-art results. Answer B refers to 'Penn Treebank BIBREF13,' which is a different dataset. Since both answers identify distinct datasets, they cannot be considered semantically equivalent in the context of the query, which asks for a specific dataset."
