    "predict": "The clinical datasets used in the paper are:\n1. MEDDOCAN: Medical Document Anonymization shared task dataset (BIBREF3)\n2. NUBes (a corpus of real medical reports in Spanish) (BIBREF4)",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists the clinical datasets used in the paper without additional context, while Answer B provides detailed descriptions of each dataset mentioned in Answer A. Although both answers refer to the same datasets, Answer B offers more information about their nature and purpose.
