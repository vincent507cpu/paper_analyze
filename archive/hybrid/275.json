    "query": "Why masking words in the decoder is helpful?",
    "gold_answer": "ecause this process is similar to the cloze task in BERT's pre-train process, therefore by using the ability of the contextual language model the decoder can generate more fluent and natural sequences.",
    "predict": "Masking words in the decoder helps improve performance on NMT models by providing additional context beyond just word vectors and improving other features like batch norm calculations.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A focuses on the similarity between masking words in the decoder and the cloze task in BERT's pre-training, emphasizing the generation of fluent and natural sequences. Answer B, on the other hand, discusses the improvement of performance in NMT models through additional context and enhancements in features like batch normalization. While both answers address the benefits of masking words, they highlight different aspects and mechanisms, indicating that they are not semantically equivalent in their explanations of why masking is helpful."
