    "query": "How effective is their NCEL approach overall?",
    "gold_answer": "NCEL consistently outperforms various baselines with a favorable generalization ability",
    "predict": "Overall effective.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed evaluation of the NCEL approach, stating that it consistently outperforms various baselines and has favorable generalization ability. This indicates a high level of effectiveness. Answer B, however, simply states 'Overall effective,' which is vague and does not provide specific evidence or comparison. While both answers suggest that the NCEL approach is effective, Answer A offers a more comprehensive assessment, making the two answers not semantically equivalent in terms of detail and specificity."
