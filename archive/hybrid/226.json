    "query": "What can word subspace represent?",
    "gold_answer": "Word vectors, usually in the context of others within the same class",
    "predict": "The TF weighted word subspace can effectively represent the context of corresponding text by incorporating frequency-related information.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A refers to 'word vectors' and their relationship to others within the same class, indicating a focus on the representation of words in a vector space based on their similarities. Answer B discusses 'TF weighted word subspace' and emphasizes the incorporation of frequency-related information to represent context. While both answers relate to the concept of word subspace, they focus on different aspects: Answer A on the classification of word vectors and Answer B on the frequency aspect of representation. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent as they highlight different interpretations of what 'word subspace' can represent."
