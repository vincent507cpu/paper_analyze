    "gold_answer": "85.61%.",
    "predict": "0.32",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states a score of '85.61%', which is a high percentage indicating a strong performance. Answer B states a score of '0.32', which is a very low value and does not represent a percentage in the same context. Since the two answers represent vastly different scores and cannot be considered equivalent, they are not semantically equivalent."
