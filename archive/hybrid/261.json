    "predict": "Born-digital data was presented to the subjects for labeling into two classes.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific details about the types of data presented to the subjects, including phonemic/syllabic sounds and specific words, indicating a focus on auditory stimuli. In contrast, Answer B describes the data as 'born-digital' and mentions labeling into two classes, which does not specify the nature of the data or its relation to event-related responses. The two answers address different aspects of the data presented, making them semantically non-equivalent."
