{"query": "What were the vaccines trialed against?", "gold_answer": "Other toxic products.", "predict": "The vaccines trialed against were pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox.", "consistency": "0", "reasoning": "Answer A states that the vaccines were trialed against 'other toxic products,' which is vague and does not specify any particular diseases or conditions. In contrast, Answer B provides a detailed list of specific diseases (pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox) that the vaccines were trialed against. Since Answer A lacks specificity and does not mention any of the diseases listed in Answer B, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."}
