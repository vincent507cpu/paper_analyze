    "query": "Were any of these tasks evaluated in any previous work?",
    "gold_answer": "YesYes",
    "predict": "Yes.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'YesYes,' which appears to be a typographical error or a concatenation of 'Yes' without a space. Answer B states 'Yes.' with proper punctuation. Despite the difference in presentation, both answers affirmatively respond to the query about the evaluation of tasks in previous work. Therefore, they convey the same semantic meaning, indicating that the tasks were indeed evaluated in prior work."
