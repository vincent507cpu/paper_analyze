    "predict": "The benchmarks compared in the content were Facebook pages for QA purposes.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific datasets that were compared, including 'Affective Text,' 'Fairy Tales,' and 'ISEAR datasets.' In contrast, Answer B refers to 'Facebook pages for QA purposes,' which does not match any of the datasets mentioned in Answer A. Since the two answers refer to entirely different subjects and contexts, they are not semantically equivalent."
