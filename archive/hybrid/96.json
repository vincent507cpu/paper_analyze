    "query": "What are the two ground states observed for indeno[1,2-a]fluorene on NaCl surfaces?",
    "gold_answer": "Open-shell π-diradical state and closed-shell state with a para-quinodimethane moiety.",
    "predict": "Two ground states observed for indeno[1,2-a]fluorene on NaCl surfaces: an open-shell state (5OS) and a closed-shell state with a para-quinodimethane moiety.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Both Answer A and Answer B describe the same two ground states for indeno[1,2-a]fluorene on NaCl surfaces. Answer A explicitly names the states as 'open-shell π-diradical state' and 'closed-shell state with a para-quinodimethane moiety.' Answer B provides a slightly different phrasing, referring to the open-shell state as '5OS' but still indicates it is an open-shell state and mentions the closed-shell state with the same para-quinodimethane moiety. The essential information about the two ground states remains consistent between the two answers, making them semantically equivalent."
