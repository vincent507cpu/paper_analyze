    "query": "How does the specific-heat ratio affect the average motion of the bubble?",
    "gold_answer": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble. The bubbles with smaller specific-heat ratios have slower average motion.",
    "predict": "The specific-heat ratio affects the average motion of the bubble. It contributes little to the initial stages but significantly influences later stages such as after the shock wave passes through it.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that smaller specific-heat ratios result in slower average motion of the bubble, focusing on a direct relationship between the specific-heat ratio and the average motion. Answer B, however, indicates that the specific-heat ratio has a minimal effect initially but becomes significant later, suggesting a more complex relationship over time. While both answers acknowledge the effect of the specific-heat ratio on average motion, they describe different aspects of this relationship, making them not semantically equivalent."
