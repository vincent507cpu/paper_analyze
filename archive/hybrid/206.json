    "query": "Do they use attention?",
    "gold_answer": "YesYes",
    "predict": "Yes, they use attention.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'YesYes,' which appears to be a typographical error or a concatenation of 'Yes' without proper spacing or punctuation. Answer B provides a clear affirmation with proper punctuation, stating 'Yes, they use attention.' While both answers affirm the use of attention, Answer A lacks clarity and proper formatting, making them not semantically equivalent in a formal context."
