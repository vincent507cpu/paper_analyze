{"query": "What are the source and target domains?", "gold_answer": "Book, electronics, beauty, music, IMDB, Yelp, cell phone, baby, DVDs, kitchenwe use set 1 of the source domain as the only source with sentiment label information during training, and we evaluate the trained model on set 1 of the target domain, Book (BK), Electronics (E), Beauty (BT), and Music (M)", "predict": "Source domain: Electronics  \nTarget domain: Beauty", "consistency": "0", "reasoning": "Answer A provides a comprehensive list of various source and target domains, including specific examples and details about the training and evaluation process. In contrast, Answer B only identifies 'Electronics' as the source domain and 'Beauty' as the target domain, omitting other relevant domains mentioned in Answer A. Since Answer B does not capture the full scope of the domains discussed in Answer A and presents a different interpretation, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."}
