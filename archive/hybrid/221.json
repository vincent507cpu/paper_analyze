    "query": "What limitations do the authors demnostrate of their model?",
    "gold_answer": "Since we do not have an end-to-end dataset, the generated English poem may not work well with Shakespeare style transferwe do not have an end-to-end dataset, the generated English poem may not work well with Shakespeare style transfer as shown in Figure FIGREF12 for \"Starry Night\" with a low average content score",
    "predict": "The authors demonstrate limitations in their model due to challenges with polysemy, rare outliers, errors introduced during feature engineering, inconsistencies between methods' strengths and weaknesses, and the need for further research on mixed results from feature engineering.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A focuses on the lack of an end-to-end dataset and its impact on generating English poems in the style of Shakespeare, specifically mentioning a low average content score. Answer B, on the other hand, discusses various limitations related to polysemy, rare outliers, feature engineering errors, and inconsistencies in methods. While both answers address limitations of the model, they highlight different aspects and do not convey the same information. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
