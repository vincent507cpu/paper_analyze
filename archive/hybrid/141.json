    "gold_answer": "UnanswerableYes",
    "predict": "No, WordNet is not useful for taxonomic reasoning tasks.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'UnanswerableYes,' which suggests that the question cannot be answered definitively, implying uncertainty about WordNet's usefulness. Answer B clearly states that 'WordNet is not useful for taxonomic reasoning tasks,' providing a definitive answer. Since one answer indicates uncertainty while the other provides a clear negation, they are not semantically equivalent."
