A system evaluation using another set of 1000 headlines (Affective test).\n3. A semantic analogy test set and overall results for the original GloVe embeddings.\n4. Zero-shot testing where the actual test set is used in a different language (XLM-R).",

    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'None,' indicating that no other tasks are tested with the method. In contrast, Answer B provides a detailed list of various tasks on which the method is tested, explicitly stating that it is applied to multiple tasks. Since Answer A and Answer B convey completely opposite meanings regarding the testing of the method, they are not semantically equivalent."
