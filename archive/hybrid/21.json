    "query": "How does the transition probability of the environment affect the learning rate in the static agent?",
    "gold_answer": "As the transition probability increases, the learning rate initially rises and then declines.",
    "predict": "The transition probability affects the learning rate by determining how frequently the agent explores different environments. As the transition probability increases, the evolved learning rate decreases, leading to slower and more stable convergence within environments where stays are rare. This is consistent with the behavior observed in static agents but contrasts with the scenario of moving agents with a higher frequency of environment transitions requiring faster learning to adapt quickly.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a straightforward relationship between transition probability and learning rate, stating that the learning rate rises initially and then declines as transition probability increases. Answer B, however, elaborates on the relationship by discussing the implications of transition probability on exploration frequency and the resulting effects on learning rate and convergence. While both answers address the impact of transition probability on learning rate, Answer B introduces additional context and nuances that are not present in Answer A. Therefore, the two answers are not semantically equivalent as they convey different levels of detail and implications regarding the relationship."
