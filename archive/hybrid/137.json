    "query": "What metrics are used for evaluation?",
    "gold_answer": "translation probabilities, Labeled Attachment Scores (LAS)accuracy, Labeled Attachment Scores (LAS)",
    "predict": "The metrics used for evaluation are BLEU score, contrastive evaluation of translation of several discourse phenomena, and human evaluation.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists 'translation probabilities' and 'Labeled Attachment Scores (LAS)' as metrics for evaluation, while Answer B mentions 'BLEU score,' 'contrastive evaluation of translation of several discourse phenomena,' and 'human evaluation.' The two answers provide different sets of metrics, indicating that they are not referring to the same evaluation criteria. Since the metrics mentioned in each answer do not overlap and represent different evaluation methods, they are not semantically equivalent."
