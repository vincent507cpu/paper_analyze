    "query": "How larger are the training sets of these versions of ELMo compared to the previous ones?",
    "gold_answer": "By 14 times.up to 1.95 times larger",
    "predict": "These new ELMo embeddings have larger training sets compared to previous ones.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a specific quantitative comparison, stating that the training sets are 'by 14 times' and 'up to 1.95 times larger,' which gives precise metrics for the increase in size. Answer B, on the other hand, makes a general statement that the new ELMo embeddings have larger training sets compared to previous ones without providing specific figures. While both answers indicate that the new training sets are larger, Answer A offers specific numerical values, whereas Answer B is more vague. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent as one provides detailed information while the other does not."
