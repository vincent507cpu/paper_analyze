    "query": "Is datasets for sentiment analysis balanced?",
    "gold_answer": "No",
    "predict": "The provided text does not directly state whether the datasets for sentiment analysis are balanced. It mentions constructing unbalanced datasets with class distributions as 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4 by randomly removing positive documents from a movie dataset. The content suggests that existing NLP systems cannot accurately perform sentiment analysis on the dataset used in experiments due to its unbalanced distribution, but it does not explicitly confirm that all datasets are balanced.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a direct response of 'No,' indicating that datasets for sentiment analysis are not balanced. Answer B, however, does not provide a definitive answer; instead, it discusses the construction of unbalanced datasets and suggests that existing NLP systems struggle with unbalanced distributions. While Answer B implies that some datasets are unbalanced, it does not directly answer the query about whether datasets for sentiment analysis are balanced or not. Therefore, the two answers are not semantically equivalent, as Answer A gives a clear 'No' while Answer B is more ambiguous and does not confirm or deny the balance of datasets."
