    "query": "What are the baselines?",
    "gold_answer": "Vanilla ST baseline, encoder pre-training, in which the ST encoder is initialized from an ASR model, decoder pre-training, in which the ST decoder is initialized from an MT model, encoder-decoder pre-training, where both the encoder and decoder are pre-trained, many-to-many multi-task model where the encoders and decoders are derived from pre-trained ASR and MT models, Triangle+pre-train: BIBREF18 DBLP:conf/naacl/AnastasopoulosC18 proposed a triangle multi-task strategy for speech translationVanilla ST baseline, Pre-training baselines, Multi-task baselines, Many-to-many+pre-training, Triangle+pre-trainVanilla ST baseline: The vanilla ST BIBREF9 has only a speech encoder and a decoder. It is trained from scratch on the ST-TED corpus.\n\nPre-training baselines: We conduct three pre-training baseline experiments: 1) encoder pre-training, in which the ST encoder is initialized from an ASR model; 2) decoder pre-training, in which the ST decoder is initialized from an MT model; and 3) encoder-decoder pre-training, where both the encoder and decoder are pre-trained. The ASR model has the same architecture with vanilla ST model, trained on the mixture of ST-TED and TED-LIUM2 corpus. The MT model has a text encoder and decoder with the same architecture of which in TCEN. It is first trained on WMT data (out-of-domain) and then fine-tuned on in-domain data.\n\nMulti-task baselines: We also conduct three multi-task baseline experiments including one-to-many setting, many-to-one setting, and many-to-many setting. In the first two settings, we train the model with $\\alpha _{st}=0.75$ while $\\alpha _{asr}=0.25$ or $\\alpha _{mt}=0.25$. For many-to-many setting, we use $\\alpha _{st}=0.6, \\alpha _{asr}=0.2$ and $\\alpha _{mt}=0.2$.. For MT task, we use only in-domain data.\n\nMany-to-many+pre-training: We train a many-to-many multi-task model where the encoders and decoders are derived from pre-trained ASR and MT models. ",
    "predict": "Baselines refer to pre-existing models used for comparison in the study.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed and technical description of various types of baselines in the context of speech translation (ST), including specific methodologies and experiments conducted. Answer B, on the other hand, offers a general definition of baselines as pre-existing models used for comparison. While both answers relate to the concept of baselines, Answer A elaborates on specific types and implementations, whereas Answer B simplifies the concept without the technical details. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent as they convey different levels of specificity and context."
