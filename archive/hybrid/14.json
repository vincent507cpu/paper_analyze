    "query": "How is the function beta(r) determined in the derivation?",
    "gold_answer": "Using the vacuum Einstein equation and the Baez-Bunn form.",
    "predict": "The function β(r) is determined by solving the differential equation \\(\\beta\\cdot\\beta' = \\frac{C}{r^2}\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant. This leads to the solution\n\n\\[\nB(r) \\equiv \\beta(r)\\cdot\\beta'(r) = C \\frac{\\mathrm{d} r}{r^2}.\n\\]\n\nBy integrating both sides, we obtain:\n\n\\[\n\\beta(r) = -\\int \\frac{\\mathrm{d} r}{C r^2} = \\pm \\frac{1}{C} \\sqrt{\\frac{r_0}{r}},\n\\]\nwhere \\(r_0\\) is the initial radial distance. The minus sign makes β positive for infalling particles, ensuring consistency with the problem setup.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a general method for determining the function beta(r) by referencing the vacuum Einstein equation and the Baez-Bunn form, which implies a theoretical framework. Answer B, on the other hand, gives a specific mathematical derivation of the function beta(r) through a differential equation and its solution. While both answers relate to the determination of beta(r), Answer A is more abstract and does not provide the detailed mathematical process that Answer B does. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent as they convey different levels of detail and types of information regarding the determination of beta(r)."
