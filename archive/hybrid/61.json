    "gold_answer": "Legacies of Losing in American Politics and an expanded edition of The Rhetorical Presidency in the Princeton Classics series.",
    "predict": "Professor Tulis's forthcoming book is about Political Theory and American Politics.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific titles of Professor Tulis's forthcoming works, indicating the exact content and focus of the books. In contrast, Answer B offers a general description of the themes of the forthcoming book without specifying the titles.
