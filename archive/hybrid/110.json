    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a specific mathematical expression for the scaling form of the alternative order parameter O, while Answer B states that the scaling form is not explicitly stated. Since Answer A gives a detailed formulation and Answer B denies the existence of such a formulation in the provided content, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
