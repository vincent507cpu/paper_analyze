    "query": "What does the new Iraqi Body Count organization do?",
    "gold_answer": "It provides cover for the war and allows supporters of the illegal war to point to it.",
    "predict": "The new Iraqi Body Count organization provides data and support for the number of civilian deaths in Iraq, allowing supporters of the war to claim it is improving conditions there despite criticism.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A suggests that the Iraqi Body Count organization serves to provide cover for the war and supports those who advocate for it, implying a negative connotation and a focus on enabling war supporters. Answer B, on the other hand, describes the organization as providing data on civilian deaths, which can be used by supporters to argue that conditions are improving, but it does not imply that the organization itself is merely providing cover. The two answers present fundamentally different perspectives on the organization's role, with Answer A focusing on a negative interpretation and Answer B providing a more neutral description of its function. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
