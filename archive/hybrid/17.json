    "gold_answer": "L = 8 and L = 14.",
    "predict": "The size chains used in the benchmarking were not specified in the given text.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific sizes for the chains used in benchmarking, stating 'L = 8 and L = 14.' In contrast, Answer B claims that the sizes were not specified at all. Since Answer A gives concrete information while Answer B denies the existence of such information, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
