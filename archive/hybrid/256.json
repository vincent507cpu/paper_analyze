    "query": "What evidence do the authors present that the model can capture some biases in data annotation and collection?",
    "gold_answer": "The authors showed few tweets where neither and implicit hatred content exist but the model was able to discriminate",
    "predict": "The authors present evidence that the model can capture biases in data annotation and collection through their analysis of errors caused by biased data collection practices (Waseem et al., BIBREF5) and biases in annotation rules (Davidson et al., BIBREF9). The study highlights 11 out of 351 documents being discarded due to annotation biases, demonstrating how the model can identify these issues.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a vague example of tweets where the model discriminates between content, but it does not clearly explain how this relates to biases in data annotation and collection. In contrast, Answer B explicitly details the evidence presented by the authors, including specific references to studies and quantifiable data regarding errors and biases in annotation practices. Therefore, Answer A lacks the depth and specificity found in Answer B, making them not semantically equivalent."
