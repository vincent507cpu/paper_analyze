    "query": "What previous methods is their model compared to?",
    "gold_answer": "bag-of-words model, CNN",
    "predict": "Their model compares to previous models using audio features and resolves issues with predictions of being incorrect for the neutral class.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific models, 'bag-of-words model' and 'CNN,' which are traditional methods in text processing and image recognition, respectively. Answer B, however, describes a broader context of comparison, focusing on the use of audio features and addressing prediction issues related to a specific class. The two answers do not convey the same information; Answer A provides specific models, while Answer B discusses a different aspect of model comparison. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
