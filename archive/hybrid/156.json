{"query": "How are models evaluated in this human-machine communication game?", "gold_answer": "by training an autocomplete system on 500K randomly sampled sentences from Yelp reviewsefficiency of a communication scheme $(q_{\\alpha },p_{\\beta })$ by the retention rate of tokens, which is measured as the fraction of tokens that are kept in the keywords, accuracy of a scheme is measured as the fraction of sentences generated by greedily decoding the model that exactly matches the target sentence", "predict": "Models are evaluated by comparing the machine-generated labels against human annotated samples in cross-lingual systems.", "consistency": "0", "reasoning": "Answer A describes a specific method of evaluating models based on training an autocomplete system and measuring retention rates and accuracy through token retention and sentence matching. Answer B, on the other hand, discusses evaluation through comparison of machine-generated labels with human annotations in cross-lingual systems. The two answers describe different evaluation methods and criteria, indicating that they are not semantically equivalent as they focus on distinct aspects of model evaluation in human-machine communication."}
