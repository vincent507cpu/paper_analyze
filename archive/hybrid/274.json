    "predict": "The annotated clinical notes were obtained from the CE task in 2010 i2b2/VA.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a fragment that mentions 'clinical notes from the CE task in 2010 i2b2/VA,' but it lacks a complete sentence structure. Answer B, however, clearly states that 'The annotated clinical notes were obtained from the CE task in 2010 i2b2/VA,' which conveys the same information in a complete and grammatically correct manner. Both answers refer to the same source of the annotated clinical notes, making them semantically equivalent despite the difference in structure."
