    "query": "What is the name of the generative interactive model used in the method?",
    "gold_answer": "The generative interactive model used in the method is called the Coupled Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (C-GDBN).",
    "predict": "C-GDBN",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides the full name of the generative interactive model, 'Coupled Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (C-GDBN),' while Answer B uses the abbreviation 'C-GDBN.' Both answers refer to the same model, with Answer B being a shorthand version of the name provided in Answer A. Therefore, they are semantically equivalent in the context of the query."
