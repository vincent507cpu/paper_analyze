    "query": "What was the baseline for this task?",
    "gold_answer": "The baseline system for the SLC task is a very simple logistic regression classifier with default parameters. The baseline for the FLC task generates spans and selects one of the 18 techniques randomly.SLC task is a very simple logistic regression classifier, FLC task generates spans and selects one of the 18 techniques randomly",
    "predict": "The baseline for this task was a seq2seq model with attention provided by the shared task organizers, which uses an embedding of two adjacent words to receive contextual information.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A describes the baseline for two different tasks (SLC and FLC) and mentions a logistic regression classifier and a random selection of techniques. Answer B, however, refers to a seq2seq model with attention as the baseline for the task. Since Answer A and Answer B refer to different models and approaches for the baseline, they are not semantically equivalent. The context and specifics of the baselines differ significantly between the two answers."
