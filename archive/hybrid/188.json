    "query": "What embedding techniques are explored in the paper?",
    "gold_answer": "Skip–gram, CBOWintegrated vector-res, vector-faith, Skip–gram, CBOW",
    "predict": "The paper explores embedding techniques. Specifically, it introduces two types of embeddings: INLINEFORM0 for each word/mention and INLINEFORM1 for multiple sense embeddings, where INLINEFORM2 refers to an entity embedding while INLINEFORM3 and INLINEFORM4 differentiate between them as discussed in the text. Additionally, there is a focus on models that consider co-occurrence information and structured entity relations encoded by INLINEFORM5 using hyperlinks and INLINEFORM6 modeling structured entity relations in KBs.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific embedding techniques such as 'Skip–gram' and 'CBOW,' which are well-known methods in natural language processing. Answer B, however, provides a more detailed description of various embedding techniques but does not explicitly mention 'Skip–gram' or 'CBOW.' Instead, it introduces terms like INLINEFORM0, INLINEFORM1, INLINEFORM2, INLINEFORM3, INLINEFORM4, INLINEFORM5, and INLINEFORM6, which are not defined in the context of the query. Since Answer B does not directly address the specific techniques mentioned in Answer A and introduces new terms without clear equivalence, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
