    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific datasets used for evaluation, namely the CSAT dataset, 20 newsgroups, and Fisher Phase 1 corpus. Answer B, however, does not specify the names of the datasets but instead refers to them in a general sense, indicating they are standard datasets for emotion classification. Since Answer B does not provide the same specific information as Answer A, they are not semantically equivalent."
