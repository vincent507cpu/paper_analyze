    "query": "How is the quality of the data empirically evaluated? ",
    "gold_answer": "Validated transcripts were sent to professional translators., various sanity checks to the translations,  sanity check the overlaps of train, development and test setscomputed sentence-level BLEU, We manually inspected examples where the source transcript was identical to the translation, measured the perplexity of the translations, computed the ratio of English characters in the translations, calculate similarity scores between transcripts and translations",
    "predict": "The quality of the data is empirically evaluated by comparing the model's performance when trained and evaluated with monolingual versus parallel data.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed list of methods used to empirically evaluate the quality of data, including validation, sanity checks, BLEU scores, and manual inspections. Answer B, on the other hand, discusses the evaluation of data quality in terms of model performance with different types of data (monolingual vs. parallel). While both answers relate to the evaluation of data quality, they focus on different aspects and methodologies. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent as they do not convey the same meaning or approach to the evaluation process."
