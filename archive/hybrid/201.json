    "query": "What are strong baselines model is compared to?",
    "gold_answer": "Baseline models are:\n- Chen et al., 2015a\n- Chen et al., 2015b\n- Liu et al., 2016\n- Cai and Zhao, 2016\n- Cai et al., 2017\n- Zhou et al., 2017\n- Ma et al., 2018\n- Wang et al., 2019",
    "predict": "MLE, RL, GAN, SeqGAN.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific baseline models referenced in various studies, while Answer B mentions types of learning methods (Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Reinforcement Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks, and SeqGAN). The two answers provide different types of information: Answer A focuses on specific models, whereas Answer B focuses on methodologies. Since they address different aspects of baseline comparisons, they are not semantically equivalent."
