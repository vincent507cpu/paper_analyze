    "query": "In which electorate was Simon English elected to the New Zealand Parliament?",
    "gold_answer": "The Wallace electorate.",
    "predict": "Clutha-Southland",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that Simon English was elected in the 'Wallace electorate,' while Answer B states 'Clutha-Southland.' These are two distinct electorates in New Zealand, indicating different geographical areas and political constituencies. Since the question asks for a specific electorate and the answers refer to different ones, they are not semantically equivalent."
