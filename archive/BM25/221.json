    "gold_answer": "Since we do not have an end-to-end dataset, the generated English poem may not work well with Shakespeare style transferwe do not have an end-to-end dataset, the generated English poem may not work well with Shakespeare style transfer as shown in Figure FIGREF12 for \"Starry Night\" with a low average content score",
    "predict": "The authors demonstrate limitations in their model due to:\n- Polysemy (ambiguity in word meanings)\n- Presence of very rare outlier words",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A discusses a specific limitation related to the lack of an end-to-end dataset affecting the quality of generated English poems in the context of Shakespeare style transfer. It focuses on a particular example and mentions a low average content score. Answer B, on the other hand, lists general limitations such as polysemy and rare outlier words, which are broader issues not directly tied to the specific context of the model's performance in generating poems. Since the two answers address different aspects of limitations and do not convey the same information, they are not semantically equivalent."
