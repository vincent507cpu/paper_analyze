    "query": "How are weights dynamically adjusted?",
    "gold_answer": "One can think $(1-p_{i1})$ as a weight associated with each example, which changes as training proceeds. The intuition of changing $p_{i1}$ to $(1-p_{i1}) p_{i1}$ is to push down the weight of easy examples. For easy examples whose probability are approaching 0 or 1, $(1-p_{i1}) p_{i1}$ makes the model attach significantly less focus to them. Figure FIGREF23 gives gives an explanation from the perspective in derivative: the derivative of $\\frac{(1-p)p}{1+(1-p)p}$ with respect to $p$ approaches 0 immediately after $p$ approaches 0, which means the model attends less to examples once they are correctly classified.associates each training example with a weight in proportion to $(1-p)$, and this weight dynamically changes as training proceeds",
    "predict": "Weights are dynamically adjusted by optimizing the model parameters and example weights together at each training step. Examples' weights are also changed based on their difficulty during training.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed explanation of how weights are adjusted based on the probability of examples being classified correctly, emphasizing the mathematical relationship and the impact of example difficulty on weight adjustment. Answer B, while less detailed, conveys the same core idea that weights are adjusted based on the difficulty of examples and the optimization of model parameters. Both answers address the dynamic nature of weight adjustment in relation to example difficulty, making them semantically equivalent despite the difference in detail and presentation."
