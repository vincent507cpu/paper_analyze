    "query": "What was the baseline for this task?",
    "gold_answer": "The baseline system for the SLC task is a very simple logistic regression classifier with default parameters. The baseline for the FLC task generates spans and selects one of the 18 techniques randomly.SLC task is a very simple logistic regression classifier, FLC task generates spans and selects one of the 18 techniques randomly",
    "predict": "The baseline for the SLC task was a very simple logistic regression classifier that represented input instances with the length of the sentence.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A describes the baseline for the SLC task as a simple logistic regression classifier with default parameters and mentions the FLC task's baseline as generating spans and selecting techniques randomly. Answer B, however, states that the baseline for the SLC task was a logistic regression classifier that represented input instances based on sentence length. The two answers provide different details about the SLC task's baseline, specifically regarding the parameters and representation of input instances. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
