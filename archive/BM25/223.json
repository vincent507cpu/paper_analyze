    "query": "What were their distribution results?",
    "gold_answer": "Distributions of Followers, Friends and URLs are significantly different between the set of tweets containing fake news and those non containing them, but for Favourites, Mentions, Media, Retweets and Hashtags they are not significantly different",
    "predict": "As the temperature becomes larger, forward perplexity increases gradually while Self-BLEU decreases.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A discusses the distribution results of various social media metrics (Followers, Friends, URLs, etc.) in relation to tweets containing fake news versus those that do not. Answer B, however, addresses the relationship between temperature and perplexity in a different context, likely related to language models or text generation. The topics and metrics discussed in both answers are entirely different, indicating that they do not convey the same information or findings regarding distribution results. Therefore, the answers are not semantically equivalent."
