    "query": "What are the results from these proposed strategies?",
    "gold_answer": "Reward of 11.8 for the A2C-chained model, 41.8 for the KG-A2C-chained model, 40 for A2C-Explore and 44 for KG-A2C-Explore.KG-A2C-chained and KG-A2C-Explore both pass the bottleneck of a score of 40",
    "predict": "The results from these proposed strategies show that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by an absolute 1.88% F1-score when evaluated on a test dataset using the three metrics: precision, recall, and weighted-average F1-score.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific numerical results for different models and indicates which models pass a certain score threshold. Answer B, on the other hand, discusses the performance of an approach in terms of F1-score and its comparison to previous methods, without providing specific results for the proposed strategies mentioned in the query. The two answers address different aspects of the results and do not convey the same information, making them not semantically equivalent."
