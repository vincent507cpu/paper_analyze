    "query": "What is the average magnetic moment per column in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films?",
    "gold_answer": "1425 $\\mu_{B}$.",
    "predict": "The average magnetic moment per column in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films is not specified directly from the given content. The text describes various phases and conditions but does not provide specific data on magnetic moments per column.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a specific numerical value for the average magnetic moment per column in Ge$_1-x$Mn$_x$ films, stating it as 1425 $\\mu_B$. In contrast, Answer B indicates that the average magnetic moment is not specified and discusses the lack of direct data in the provided content. Since Answer A gives a concrete figure while Answer B denies the existence of such a figure, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
