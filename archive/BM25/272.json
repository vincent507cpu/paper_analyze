    "query": "Is the data de-identified?",
    "gold_answer": "YesYes",
    "predict": "No",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'YesYes,' which appears to be a typographical error or a repetition of 'Yes,' indicating that the data is indeed de-identified. Answer B states 'No,' which directly contradicts Answer A. Since one answer affirms de-identification and the other denies it, they are not semantically equivalent."
