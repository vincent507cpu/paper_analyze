    "query": "What is the main focus of the research paper?",
    "gold_answer": "Nuclear liquid-gas transition in lattice QCD.",
    "predict": "The main focus of the research paper is whether Twitter sentiment classification problems can benefit from multitask learning.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A discusses the nuclear liquid-gas transition in lattice QCD, which pertains to a specific area of physics research. Answer B, on the other hand, addresses Twitter sentiment classification and multitask learning, which is related to machine learning and social media analysis. Since the topics of the two answers are entirely different and do not overlap in focus, they are not semantically equivalent."
