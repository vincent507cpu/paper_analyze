    "gold_answer": "Chinese Mandarin, Welsh, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Kiswahili, Yue ChineseChinese Mandarin, Welsh, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Kiswahili, Yue Chinese",
    "predict": "The 12 languages covered are: Welsh, Kiswahili.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists a comprehensive set of 12 languages, including Chinese Mandarin, Welsh, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Kiswahili, and Yue Chinese. In contrast, Answer B only mentions two languages: Welsh and Kiswahili, failing to provide the complete list. Since Answer B does not encompass all the languages mentioned in Answer A, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
