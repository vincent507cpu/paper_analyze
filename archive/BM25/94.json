    "query": "What does the paper aim to solve?",
    "gold_answer": "The paper aims to solve nonlinear system vibration problems efficiently.",
    "predict": "The paper aims to solve problems related to unsupervised contour completion in biomedical domains.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A focuses on 'nonlinear system vibration problems,' while Answer B addresses 'problems related to unsupervised contour completion in biomedical domains.' The topics of the two answers are entirely different, with Answer A dealing with vibrations in systems and Answer B concerning contour completion in a specific field. Since they address different problems and contexts, the answers are not semantically equivalent."
