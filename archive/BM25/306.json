    "predict": "The dataset contains 6946 sentences, as stated in the content provided: \"As neural networks are proved effective in irony detection, we decide to implement a neural classifier in order to classify the sentences into ironic and non-ironic sentences. However, the only high-quality irony dataset we can obtain is the dataset of Semeval-2018 Task 3 and the dataset is pretty small, which will cause overfitting to complex models. Therefore, we just implement a simple one-layer RNN with LSTM cell to classify pre-processed sentences into ironic sentences and non-ironic sentences.\"",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a specific numerical value, 36066946, indicating the total number of sentences in the dataset. In contrast, Answer B states that the dataset contains 6946 sentences, which is a different numerical value. Additionally, Answer B includes contextual information about the dataset but does not confirm the total number of sentences as stated in Answer A. Since the two answers provide different numerical values for the number of sentences, they are not semantically equivalent."
