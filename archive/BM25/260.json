    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific datasets related to ERP and behavioral data from Frank et al. (2015) and (2013), while Answer B provides a completely different set of datasets (CoNLL2003, OntoNotes5.0, MSRA, OntoNotes4.0) that are unrelated to the context of Answer A. Since the datasets mentioned in both answers do not overlap or refer to the same sources, they are not semantically equivalent."
