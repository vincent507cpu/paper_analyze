    "query": "How does this approach compare to other WSD approaches employing word embeddings?",
    "gold_answer": "GM$\\_$KL achieves better correlation than existing approaches for various metrics on SCWS dataset.",
    "predict": "Word injection alignment on PPMI vectors with CD is compared to other approaches involving word embeddings. It avoids complex alignment and applies to both embedding-based methods and count-based methods like CD. Two implementations of the word injection approach showed different results based on data sets, indicating variability in effectiveness across contexts.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A focuses on the performance of GM_KL in comparison to existing WSD approaches, specifically mentioning better correlation metrics on the SCWS dataset. In contrast, Answer B discusses a different method (word injection alignment on PPMI vectors) and its comparison to other approaches, emphasizing its applicability and variability in effectiveness. The two answers address different aspects of WSD approaches and do not provide a direct comparison of the same methods or metrics, making them semantically non-equivalent."
