    "predict": "The datasets used for evaluation are standardly used datasets for evaluating emotion classification.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific datasets such as CNN/DailyMail, New York Times Annotated Corpus, and XSum, which are concrete examples of datasets used for evaluation. In contrast, Answer B refers to 'standardly used datasets for evaluating emotion classification' without naming any specific datasets. The lack of specificity in Answer B and its focus on emotion classification rather than the datasets mentioned in Answer A indicates that the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
