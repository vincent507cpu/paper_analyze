    "query": "What are the source and target domains?",
    "gold_answer": "Book, electronics, beauty, music, IMDB, Yelp, cell phone, baby, DVDs, kitchenwe use set 1 of the source domain as the only source with sentiment label information during training, and we evaluate the trained model on set 1 of the target domain, Book (BK), Electronics (E), Beauty (BT), and Music (M)",
    "predict": "Source domain: Electronics  \nTarget domain: Beauty",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a comprehensive list of various source and target domains, including multiple categories such as Book, Electronics, Beauty, and Music, and explains the context of their use in training and evaluation. Answer B, however, only specifies 'Electronics' as the source domain and 'Beauty' as the target domain, omitting other domains mentioned in Answer A. Since Answer B does not encompass the full scope of domains referenced in Answer A, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
