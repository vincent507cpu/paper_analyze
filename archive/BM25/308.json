    "query": "Does their NER model learn NER from both text and images?",
    "gold_answer": "YesYes",
    "predict": "Yes, their NER model learns NER from both text and images through its feature extraction process involving Bi-LSTM and CRF.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A simply states 'YesYes,' which is an unclear affirmation and does not provide any additional context or details. Answer B, on the other hand, elaborates that the NER model learns from both text and images and specifies the methods used (Bi-LSTM and CRF) for feature extraction. While both answers affirm that the NER model learns from both text and images, Answer A lacks the necessary detail to be considered semantically equivalent to Answer B, which provides a comprehensive explanation."
