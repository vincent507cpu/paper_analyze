For the analysis of how Î³ values should be set for each shape, we used the simple dataset as a reference. Results and ablations ::: Ablation studies",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific types of experiments related to classifiers for irony and sentiment analysis, while Answer B discusses the use of datasets and evaluation methods without mentioning any specific experiments. The content and focus of the answers are entirely different, as Answer A is about the types of experiments conducted, whereas Answer B describes the methodology and datasets used in experiments. Therefore, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
