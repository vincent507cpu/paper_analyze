    "predict": "Logistic Regression, DL models trained on clinical-RQE data.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific models used in the experiment, including linear SVM, BiLSTM, and CNN, while also mentioning the training context for the linear SVM. Answer B, however, refers to Logistic Regression and DL models trained on a different dataset (clinical-RQE data). Since the models mentioned in both answers are different and pertain to different methodologies, they are not semantically equivalent."
