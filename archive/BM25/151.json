    "query": "Which languages are similar to each other?",
    "gold_answer": "Nguni languages (zul, xho, nbl, ssw), Sotho languages (nso, sot, tsn)The Nguni languages are similar to each other, The same is true of the Sotho languages",
    "predict": "Devanagari languages",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific language groups (Nguni and Sotho) and states that the languages within these groups are similar to each other. Answer B, however, refers to 'Devanagari languages,' which is a script used for several languages, not a language group itself. Since Answer A discusses similarities among specific language groups while Answer B does not address any similarities and refers to a script instead, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
