    "gold_answer": "Symptoms of vitamin K deficiency include anemia, bruising, nosebleeds, bleeding of the gums, and heavy menstrual bleeding in women.",
    "predict": "Symptoms of vitamin K deficiency include bleeding in infants and mild to severe bleeding in adults due to anemia.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific symptoms associated with vitamin K deficiency, such as anemia, bruising, nosebleeds, and heavy menstrual bleeding. Answer B mentions bleeding in infants and adults, also linking it to anemia.
