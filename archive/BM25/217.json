    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'No,' indicating that the answered questions do not measure the usefulness of the answer. In contrast, Answer B asserts 'Yes,' claiming that the answered questions do measure for the usefulness of the answer. Since the two answers provide opposing views on the same question, they are not semantically equivalent."
