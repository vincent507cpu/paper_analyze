    "predict": "No, they report results only on English data.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'Unanswerable,' indicating that the question cannot be answered definitively. Answer B provides a clear response, stating that results are reported only on English data. Since one answer suggests that the question cannot be answered while the other provides a specific answer, they are not semantically equivalent."
