    "query": "What type of evaluation is proposed for this task?",
    "gold_answer": "Answer with content missing: (Evaluation Metrics section) Precision, Recall, F1-scores, Strict match, METEOR, ROUGE-2",
    "predict": "The type of evaluation proposed for this task is a **word analogy task** and named entity recognition (NER) task.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists various evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-scores, which are commonly used to assess the performance of models in tasks like classification and information retrieval. In contrast, Answer B describes the proposed evaluation as a 'word analogy task' and 'named entity recognition (NER) task,' which are specific types of tasks rather than metrics. Since Answer A focuses on metrics for evaluation while Answer B specifies the types of tasks being evaluated, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
