    "predict": "They use multiple languages in their experiment to avoid grouping them into single-member groups based on language family. The specific number of languages used is between two and three per random grouping.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists a comprehensive set of languages used in the experiment, while Answer B provides a general statement about using multiple languages without specifying which ones. Answer A gives specific languages, indicating a broader range, whereas Answer B focuses on the concept of grouping languages without detailing the actual languages involved. Therefore, the two answers do not convey the same information and are not semantically equivalent."
