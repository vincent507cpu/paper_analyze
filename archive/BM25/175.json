    "predict": "The model combines audio and text sequences by feeding them into dual RNNs (recurrent neural networks) for encoding. It then uses a feed-forward neural model to combine the encoded representations from these sources to predict an emotion class.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Both answers describe a process of combining audio and text sequences using dual RNNs for encoding and a feed-forward neural model for combination. Answer A mentions the use of dual RNNs and a feed-forward model but does not specify the prediction of an emotion class. Answer B explicitly states that the model predicts an emotion class after combining the encoded representations. While the core processes are similar, the additional detail in Answer B about predicting an emotion class adds a layer of specificity that is not present in Answer A. Therefore, the answers are not semantically equivalent."
