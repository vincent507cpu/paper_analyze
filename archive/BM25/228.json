    "query": "Is SemCor3.0 reflective of English language data in general?",
    "gold_answer": "YesUnanswerable",
    "predict": "No, SemCor3.0 is not reflective of English language data in general, as it contains training and development/test sets with notable differences due to its focus on real-world news topics that may introduce new terms, names, phrases, etc.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'YesUnanswerable,' which suggests that the question cannot be definitively answered with a 'yes' or 'no.' In contrast, Answer B provides a detailed explanation indicating that SemCor3.0 is not reflective of English language data in general, highlighting specific reasons for this conclusion. Since Answer A implies uncertainty while Answer B provides a clear negation, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
