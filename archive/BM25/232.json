    "query": "Are the automatically constructed datasets subject to quality control?",
    "gold_answer": "NoNo",
    "predict": "Yes, the automatically constructed datasets are subject to quality control.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'NoNo,' which implies that the automatically constructed datasets are not subject to quality control. In contrast, Answer B explicitly states that they are subject to quality control. Since the two answers convey opposite meanings regarding the quality control of the datasets, they are not semantically equivalent."
