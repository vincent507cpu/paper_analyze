    "gold_answer": "Answer with content missing: (Data section) Chinese with version 5.1 of the Chinese Penn Treebank (CTB)",
    "predict": "The Chinese datasets used in this context were not explicitly mentioned.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific information about a dataset, namely the Chinese Penn Treebank (CTB) version 5.1, indicating that it is one of the datasets used. In contrast, Answer B states that the Chinese datasets used were not explicitly mentioned, which implies a lack of information. Since Answer A gives a specific dataset while Answer B indicates that no datasets were mentioned, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
