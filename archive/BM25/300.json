    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A refers to a specific column in a table, indicating a location where scores can be found, while Answer B provides a numerical score. These two answers do not convey the same information; Answer A does not provide a score itself but rather a reference to where it can be found, whereas Answer B gives a specific score. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
