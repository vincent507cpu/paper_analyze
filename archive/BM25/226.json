    "query": "What can word subspace represent?",
    "gold_answer": "Word vectors, usually in the context of others within the same class",
    "predict": "The TF weighted word subspace represents sets of word vectors by incorporating frequency-based information (term-frequency) from words.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A describes 'word vectors' in a general context, indicating that they are related to others within the same class. Answer B, however, specifies 'TF weighted word subspace' and elaborates on how it incorporates frequency-based information. While both answers discuss word vectors, Answer B provides a more detailed and specific explanation about the representation and context of these vectors. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent as they convey different levels of detail and context regarding the concept of word subspace."
