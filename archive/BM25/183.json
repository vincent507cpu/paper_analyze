    "query": "What architecture does the decoder have?",
    "gold_answer": "LSTMLSTM",
    "predict": "Encoder-decoder architecture with Bert-based Decoder",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A specifies 'LSTMLSTM,' which indicates a type of architecture based on Long Short-Term Memory networks. Answer B describes an 'Encoder-decoder architecture with Bert-based Decoder,' which refers to a different architecture that incorporates BERT in the decoding process. Since these two answers refer to fundamentally different architectures, they are not semantically equivalent."
