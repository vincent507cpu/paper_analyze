    "query": "How does their ensemble method work?",
    "gold_answer": "simply averaging the predictions from the constituent single models",
    "predict": "The ensemble method involves forming predictions from different training epochs and using their average as the final estimate. This approach simplifies the model by combining multiple outputs into one prediction without significantly compromising performance compared to more complex methods like multi-column networks.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A describes the ensemble method as 'simply averaging the predictions from the constituent single models,' which indicates a straightforward averaging approach. Answer B, however, elaborates on the method by mentioning 'forming predictions from different training epochs' and emphasizes the simplification of the model while comparing it to more complex methods. While both answers mention averaging, Answer B introduces additional context and details that are not present in Answer A. Therefore, the two answers are not semantically equivalent as they convey different levels of detail and context regarding the ensemble method."
