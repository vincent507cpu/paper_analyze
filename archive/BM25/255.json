    "query": "How much improvement is gained from Adversarial Reward Augmented Maximum Likelihood (ARAML)?",
    "gold_answer": "ARAM has achieved improvement over all baseline methods using reverese perplexity and  slef-BLEU metric.  The maximum reverse perplexity improvement 936,16 is gained for EMNLP2017  WMT  dataset and  48,44 for COCO dataset.Compared to the baselines, ARAML does not do better in terms of perplexity on COCO and EMNLP 2017 WMT datasets, but it does by up to 0.27 Self-BLEU points on COCO and 0.35 Self-BLEU on EMNLP 2017 WMT. In terms of Grammaticality and Relevance, it scores better than the baselines on up to 75.5% and 73% of the cases respectively.",
    "predict": "The exact improvement gained by Adversarial Reward Augmented Maximum Likelihood (ARAML) is not specified in the given content. The text describes how ARAML addresses instability issues in GANs for text generation through adversarial training but does not provide specific quantitative results on performance improvements compared to other methods or baseline models.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific quantitative improvements achieved by ARAML over baseline methods, detailing metrics such as reverse perplexity and Self-BLEU scores. In contrast, Answer B states that the exact improvement is not specified and focuses on the qualitative aspects of ARAML's performance without providing numerical data. Since Answer A gives concrete figures and comparisons, while Answer B claims a lack of specific improvement data, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
