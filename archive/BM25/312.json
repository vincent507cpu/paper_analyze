    "query": "How do the authors evidence the claim that many engineers find it a big overhead to choose from multiple frameworks, models and optimization techniques?",
    "gold_answer": "By conducting a survey among engineersUnanswerable",
    "predict": "The authors evidence this claim through several specific observations:\n- The sampling overhead is relatively low for M=1 and M=2 but increases with increasing M (M>2).\n- They observe that the optimization sometimes yields a denoiser with large γ (high overhead) and other times with small γ.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the authors evidence the claim by conducting a survey among engineers, which suggests a method of data collection. However, it does not provide specific details or observations related to the claim. Answer B, on the other hand, provides specific observations and data points that directly relate to the claim about the overhead experienced by engineers when choosing frameworks and techniques. Since Answer A lacks the necessary detail and context to support the claim effectively, while Answer B provides concrete evidence, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
