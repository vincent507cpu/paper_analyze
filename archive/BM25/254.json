    "query": "How big is the difference in performance between proposed model and baselines?",
    "gold_answer": "Metric difference between Aloha and best baseline score:\nHits@1/20: +0.061 (0.3642 vs 0.3032)\nMRR: +0.0572(0.5114 vs 0.4542)\nF1: -0.0484 (0.3901 vs 0.4385)\nBLEU: +0.0474 (0.2867 vs 0.2393)",
    "predict": "The proposed model outperforms baselines across all ranges of relative distances. Specifically, it achieves better performance in capturing both short and long-term answer-relevant dependencies.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific quantitative metrics comparing the proposed model's performance to the best baseline scores across various metrics (Hits@1/20, MRR, F1, BLEU). Answer B, on the other hand, makes a qualitative statement about the proposed model outperforming baselines in general terms without providing specific numerical differences. While both answers address the performance comparison, Answer A gives concrete data, whereas Answer B offers a broader, less quantifiable assertion. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent as they convey different types of information regarding performance differences."
