    "predict": "Event-related responses were presented to the subjects in the form of microposts containing keywords like \"hack\" in the context of Cyber attack events.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A details specific phonemic and word stimuli presented to subjects to elicit event-related responses, focusing on speech sounds and words. In contrast, Answer B describes a different type of stimulus, namely microposts related to Cyber attack events. The content and context of the stimuli in both answers are fundamentally different, indicating that they are not semantically equivalent."
