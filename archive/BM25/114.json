    "query": "How is the ground truth for fake news established?",
    "gold_answer": "Ground truth is not established in the paper",
    "predict": "The ground truth for fake news is established based on characteristics of the accounts that produce the tweets containing fake news, specifically unverified accounts.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that ground truth is not established in the paper, indicating a lack of methodology or conclusion regarding the establishment of ground truth.
