    "query": "Do they use attention?",
    "gold_answer": "YesYes",
    "predict": "Yes, they use attention.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'YesYes,' which appears to be a typographical error or a concatenation of 'Yes' without proper spacing or punctuation. Answer B provides a clear affirmation with proper punctuation, stating 'Yes, they use attention.' While both answers affirm the use of attention, the lack of clarity and proper formatting in Answer A makes it less formal and potentially confusing. However, the core meaning of both answers is the same, indicating that attention is indeed used. Therefore, they can be considered semantically equivalent despite the formatting difference."
