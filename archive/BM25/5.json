    "query": "What was Hugh H. Goodwin's rank in the United States Navy?",
    "gold_answer": "Vice Admiral.",
    "predict": "Commander-in-Chief",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that Hugh H. Goodwin held the rank of 'Vice Admiral,' which is a specific rank within the United States Navy. Answer B refers to 'Commander-in-Chief,' which is a title that denotes the highest authority over the military but is not a rank within the Navy itself. Since these terms refer to different concepts—one being a specific rank and the other a position of authority—the answers are not semantically equivalent."
