    "query": "When will BC leave Boston?",
    "gold_answer": "August 25.",
    "predict": "BC will likely leave Boston after ac ≤ k ≤ bc - 1 or bc ≤ n ≤ m. This is based on the notation provided in the content about models and system usage.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a specific date, 'August 25,' indicating when BC will leave Boston. Answer B, however, presents a complex mathematical expression that does not directly answer the question about the departure date. The two answers address different aspects: one gives a clear date while the other discusses conditions related to a model, making them semantically non-equivalent."
