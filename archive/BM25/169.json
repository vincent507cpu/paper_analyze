    "gold_answer": "UnanswerableAnswer with content missing: (Parent subsections) combine precisions for n-gram orders 1-4",
    "predict": "Ngrams of length 2 are aligned using PARENT.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A discusses the alignment of n-grams of orders 1-4, indicating a range of lengths, while Answer B specifically states that n-grams of length 2 are aligned using PARENT. Since Answer A does not provide a definitive answer regarding a specific length but rather a range, and Answer B specifies a particular length, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
