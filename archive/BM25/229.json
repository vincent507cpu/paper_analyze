    "query": "How big is Augmented LibriSpeech dataset?",
    "gold_answer": "UnanswerableUnanswerable",
    "predict": "2.5 million training pairs.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'UnanswerableUnanswerable,' indicating that the size of the Augmented LibriSpeech dataset cannot be determined. In contrast, Answer B provides a specific size of '2.5 million training pairs.' Since one answer claims the question cannot be answered while the other provides a definitive answer, they are not semantically equivalent."
