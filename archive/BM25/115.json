    "query": "What is the GhostVLAD approach?",
    "gold_answer": "extension of the NetVLAD, adds Ghost clusters along with the NetVLAD clustersAn extension of NetVLAD which replaces hard assignment-based clustering with soft assignment-based clustering with the additon o fusing Ghost clusters to deal with noisy content.",
    "predict": "The GhostVLAD approach is a simultaneous two-sample learning method proposed to address classification tasks in low data resource scenarios.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A describes the GhostVLAD approach as an extension of NetVLAD that incorporates Ghost clusters and focuses on soft assignment-based clustering. In contrast, Answer B presents GhostVLAD as a two-sample learning method aimed at classification tasks in low data resource scenarios. The two answers provide different perspectives and details about the GhostVLAD approach, indicating that they are not semantically equivalent, as they focus on different aspects and applications of the method."
