    "query": "Do they use pretrained embeddings?",
    "gold_answer": "YesYes",
    "predict": "Yes, they use pretrained embeddings. They compare the results with and without pretraining the model to demonstrate that using pretrained embeddings significantly improves performance on various tasks, including summarization, NER, and word-level semantic similarity for different languages.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A simply states 'YesYes,' which is an unclear and redundant affirmation of the query. Answer B provides a detailed explanation confirming the use of pretrained embeddings and elaborates on their benefits in various tasks. While both answers affirm the use of pretrained embeddings, Answer A lacks the necessary detail and clarity present in Answer B. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent due to the difference in information and context provided."
