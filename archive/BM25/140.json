    "query": "What architecture does the encoder have?",
    "gold_answer": "LSTMLSTM",
    "predict": "Encoder has a general global attention architecture.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A specifies 'LSTMLSTM,' which indicates a specific type of architecture based on Long Short-Term Memory networks. In contrast, Answer B describes the architecture as 'general global attention,' which refers to a different architectural approach focused on attention mechanisms. Since LSTM and global attention are fundamentally different architectures, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
