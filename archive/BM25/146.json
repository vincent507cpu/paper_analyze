    "reasoning": "Answer A specifies a quantity of data in terms of the number of sentences, while Answer B provides the data size in gigabytes. These two answers represent different metrics for measuring data: one is a count of sentences and the other is a size measurement. Since they do not convey the same information about the data required for training the encoder, they are not semantically equivalent."
