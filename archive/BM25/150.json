    "query": "LDA is an unsupervised method; is this paper introducing an unsupervised approach to spam detection?",
    "gold_answer": "NoNo",
    "predict": "Yes, this paper introduces an unsupervised approach to spam detection through its joint Bayesian model for unsupervised semantic role induction in multiple languages.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'NoNo,' which suggests a negative response to the query about whether the paper introduces an unsupervised approach to spam detection. In contrast, Answer B explicitly states 'Yes' and provides details about the paper's approach, confirming that it does introduce an unsupervised method. Since the two answers convey opposite meanings regarding the introduction of an unsupervised approach, they are not semantically equivalent."
