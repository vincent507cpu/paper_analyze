    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific NER tasks, including BC5CDR-disease, NCBI-disease, and others, which are relevant to Named Entity Recognition (NER). In contrast, Answer B mentions tasks that are unrelated to NER, such as document-level sentiment classification and language modeling. Since the two answers refer to entirely different sets of tasks, they are not semantically equivalent."
