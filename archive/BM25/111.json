    "query": "How are the relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables different for different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE)?",
    "gold_answer": "The relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables differ when comparing unstandardized CPUE and standardized CPUE.",
    "predict": "For different measures of catch per unit effort (CPUE), the relationships between standardised CPUE and fishing behavior variables differ based on how catches are standardized. For example:\n- Catch per set (standardised CPUE) is more meaningful for comparing catch rates across vessels using varying numbers of hooks.\n- Standardized CPUE allows higher values to indicate better management outcomes compared to raw CPUE metrics, indicating improvements in conservation or sustainability efforts.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the relationships differ when comparing unstandardized CPUE and standardized CPUE, which is a straightforward assertion about the difference in relationships based on the type of CPUE. Answer B elaborates on this by providing specific examples of how standardized CPUE relates to fishing behavior variables and the implications of using standardized versus raw CPUE metrics. While Answer B provides more detail, it ultimately addresses the same core concept of differing relationships based on the type of CPUE. Therefore, both answers are semantically equivalent in that they discuss the differences in relationships between catch per set and fishing behavior variables based on CPUE measures."
