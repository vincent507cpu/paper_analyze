    "query": "How large is their data set?",
    "gold_answer": "a sample of  29,794 wikipedia articles and 2,794 arXiv papers ",
    "predict": "The training set provided by BIBREF0 is small.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific quantitative details about the data set, mentioning the exact number of Wikipedia articles and arXiv papers included. In contrast, Answer B describes the training set as 'small' without providing any specific figures. The term 'small' is subjective and does not equate to the specific numbers given in Answer A. Therefore, the two answers do not convey the same information regarding the size of the data set."
