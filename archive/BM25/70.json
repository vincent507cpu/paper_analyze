    "query": "What are the restrictions on the use of Broadjam's servers?",
    "gold_answer": "No excessive overloading and no use for illegal activity.",
    "predict": "The restrictions on the use of Broadjam's servers by Hosting Subscriber are as follows:\n\n1. Hosting Subscriber must ensure reasonable usage to avoid overloading Broadjam's DNS and servers.\n2. Hosting Subscriber's Website content is subject to removal if it threatens the stability of Broadjam's network.\n3. Hosting Subscriber agrees to be responsible for its own password security and undertake measures to prevent loss or damage, maintain copies, secure transmission, and ensure password confidentiality.\n4. Hosting Subscriber cannot use Broadjam's servers as a source, destination address for mail bombs or any abusive activities that harm the system or disrupt service.\n\nHosting Subscriber is also prohibited from using the website or server in ways that are considered illegal or harmful to the network, such as hacking. If issues arise with passwords or other security concerns, Hosting Subscriber must notify Broadjam immediately and will be responsible for resolving them promptly.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a brief summary of the restrictions, stating 'no excessive overloading and no use for illegal activity.' Answer B, on the other hand, elaborates on these restrictions with specific details regarding reasonable usage, content removal, password security, and prohibited activities. While both answers address the same core restrictions, Answer A is a simplified version of the more comprehensive Answer B. Therefore, they convey the same essential meaning regarding the restrictions on the use of Broadjam's servers, making them semantically equivalent despite the difference in detail."
