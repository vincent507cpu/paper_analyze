    "query": "How do they match words before reordering them?",
    "gold_answer": "UnanswerableCFILT-preorder system",
    "predict": "Words are matched based on their contexts and frequencies in the sentence data. If word scores match the actual usage, they can be applied without additional validation for new domains; otherwise, domain-specific dictionaries need to be used instead.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A refers to a specific system, 'UnanswerableCFILT-preorder system,' which does not provide any details about how words are matched. In contrast, Answer B explains a process involving context and frequency of words in sentence data, along with conditions for applying word scores. Since Answer A does not address the matching process and is vague, while Answer B provides a detailed explanation, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
