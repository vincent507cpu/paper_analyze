    "query": "Do they evaluate only on English datasets?",
    "gold_answer": "YesUnanswerable",
    "predict": "No, they evaluate relation detection performance independently on English datasets.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'YesUnanswerable,' which suggests that the question cannot be answered definitively, implying that the evaluation is not limited to English datasets. Answer B explicitly states that they evaluate relation detection performance independently on English datasets, directly contradicting Answer A. Since one answer affirms a limitation while the other denies it, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
