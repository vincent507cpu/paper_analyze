    "query": "what is the source of the data?",
    "gold_answer": "Android application",
    "predict": "BLEU points",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A identifies the source of the data as an 'Android application,' which refers to a specific platform or software used to collect or generate data. Answer B, on the other hand, mentions 'BLEU points,' which are a metric used for evaluating the quality of text generated by machine translation systems. These two answers refer to entirely different concepts: one is a source of data collection, while the other is a measurement of data quality. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
