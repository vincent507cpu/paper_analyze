    "predict": "The experiment involves trying random pairings of up to three languages for multilingual training purposes.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific Indian languages that are part of the experiment, while Answer B discusses the methodology of the experiment without mentioning any specific languages. Since Answer A provides a concrete list of languages and Answer B describes a general approach without identifying any languages, the two answers do not convey the same information and are therefore not semantically equivalent."
