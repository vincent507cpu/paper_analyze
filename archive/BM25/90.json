    "query": "What happens to the high resolution of what we focus on at dawn or dusk?",
    "gold_answer": "It becomes a bit less so that what's off to the left or right can be better noted.",
    "predict": "At dawn or dusk, the high resolution of what we focus on decreases.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A suggests that the high resolution becomes 'a bit less' to allow for better noting of peripheral details, implying a relative decrease in focus. Answer B states that the high resolution 'decreases' at dawn or dusk. Both answers convey the idea that the resolution diminishes during these times, but Answer A adds a nuance about the reason for this decrease (to better note peripheral details). Despite this nuance, the core idea of a decrease in resolution is present in both answers, making them semantically equivalent in the context of the query."
