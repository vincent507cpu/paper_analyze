    "query": "On top of BERT does the RNN layer work better or the transformer layer?",
    "gold_answer": "Transformer over BERT (ToBERT)The transformer layer",
    "predict": "Transformer layer works better than RNN layer.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the transformer layer is used on top of BERT, while Answer B asserts that the transformer layer works better than the RNN layer. Both answers emphasize the superiority of the transformer layer in the context of BERT, but Answer A does not directly compare the transformer layer to the RNN layer. However, the implication in both answers is that the transformer layer is preferred over the RNN layer. Therefore, they convey a similar meaning regarding the effectiveness of the transformer layer in this context, making them semantically equivalent."
