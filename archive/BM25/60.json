    "query": "Can the denoiser be applied to circuits with non-Clifford noise?",
    "gold_answer": "Yes, the denoiser works for non-Clifford local noise channels.",
    "predict": "Yes, the denoiser can be applied to circuits with non-Clifford noise.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Both Answer A and Answer B affirm that the denoiser can be applied to circuits with non-Clifford noise. Answer A specifies that it works for non-Clifford local noise channels, which is a subset of non-Clifford noise, while Answer B directly states that the denoiser can be applied to circuits with non-Clifford noise. Since both answers convey the same overall conclusion regarding the applicability of the denoiser, they are semantically equivalent."
