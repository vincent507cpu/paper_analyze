    "query": "How does the receptive field size affect the completion of shapes?",
    "gold_answer": "Bigger receptive field size leads to more successful shape completion.",
    "predict": "The bigger the receptive field size, the more complete shapes can be reconstructed using DSP.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that a bigger receptive field size results in more successful shape completion, while Answer B indicates that a larger receptive field size allows for more complete shapes to be reconstructed using DSP (Digital Signal Processing). Both answers convey the idea that an increase in receptive field size enhances the ability to complete or reconstruct shapes, suggesting a similar underlying concept. Although Answer B adds a specific context (DSP), the core message about the effect of receptive field size on shape completion remains consistent between the two answers, making them semantically equivalent."
