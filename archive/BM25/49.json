    "query": "What was the best performing model for the Spanish language in Track-1?",
    "gold_answer": "The best performing model for the Spanish language in Track-1 was Spanish BERT.",
    "predict": "RoBERTa and BERT performed well for Spanish and Portuguese respectively, with GPT-2 being the worst performer across all languages. The two best-performing models were selected for Track-2.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A specifically identifies 'Spanish BERT' as the best performing model for the Spanish language in Track-1. In contrast, Answer B discusses multiple models, including RoBERTa and BERT, but does not confirm which model was the best for Spanish in Track-1. Instead, it mentions performance in a broader context and does not directly answer the query. Therefore, the two answers are not semantically equivalent as they provide different information regarding the best performing model."
