    "query": "what previous RNN models do they compare with?",
    "gold_answer": "Variational LSTM, CharCNN, Pointer Sentinel-LSTM, RHN, NAS Cell, SRU, QRNN, RAN, 4-layer skip-connection LSTM, AWD-LSTM, Quantized LSTM",
    "predict": "The models compared with in the text include DeepChannel, rnn-ext+RL, and NeuSUM. Additionally, they compare methods such as NMT (neural machine translation) and SMT (statistical machine translation). The experiments also focus on performance evaluation of clause alignment, feature-based models enriched with external lexicons, and the use of Transformer encoder in capturing directional features compared to previous work's LSTM-based models.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific RNN models that are compared, while Answer B mentions a different set of models and methods, including DeepChannel and rnn-ext+RL, which are not included in Answer A. Additionally, Answer B discusses broader methodologies and performance evaluations that are not directly related to the specific RNN models mentioned in Answer A. Since the two answers refer to different sets of models and approaches, they are not semantically equivalent."
