    "query": "Which hyperparameters were varied in the experiments on the four tasks?",
    "gold_answer": "number of clusters, seed value in clustering, selection of word vectors, window size and dimension of embeddingdifferent number of clusters, different embeddings",
    "predict": "The hyperparameters varied in the experiments on the four tasks were: dropout rate of 0.5 for LSTM and tree LSTM, number of hidden units in rectified network coupling layers (4, 8, 16), Adam optimizer optimization.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists hyperparameters related to clustering and embeddings, such as the number of clusters and window size, which are relevant to certain machine learning tasks. Answer B, however, discusses hyperparameters specific to LSTM networks and optimization techniques, which are entirely different from those mentioned in Answer A. Since the hyperparameters in both answers pertain to different aspects of machine learning experiments, they are not semantically equivalent."
