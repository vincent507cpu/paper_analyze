Answer B elaborates on the sourcing, specifying two datasets (STAN INLINEFORM0 and STAN INLINEFORM1) and detailing the unique hashtags and their origins. While both answers reference the same source (the Stanford Sentiment Analysis Dataset) and the same number of unique hashtags, Answer B includes additional context about the datasets and corrections, which makes it more detailed but not fundamentally different in meaning. Therefore, both answers convey the same essential information about the sourcing of the dataset of hashtags."
