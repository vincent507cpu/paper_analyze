    "query": "How does Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention works?",
    "gold_answer": "pays attentions to adjacent characters and casts a localness relationship between the characters as a fixed Gaussian weight assuming the weight relies on the distance between charactersGaussian-masked directional attention can be described as a function to map queries and key-value pairs to the representation of input, Gaussian-masked directional attention expects to pay attention to the adjacent characters of each positions and cast the localness relationship between characters as a fix Gaussian weight for attention, Gaussian weight only relys on the distance between characters",
    "predict": "Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention works by using Gaussian masks and multiple heads to capture information from different positions in an input sentence. This improves upon standard multi-head self-attention by enhancing the model's ability to generate representations that account for local, position, and directional aspects relevant for CWS tasks.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A focuses on the mechanism of Gaussian-masked directional attention, emphasizing the localness relationship and the fixed Gaussian weight based on the distance between characters. It describes how attention is paid to adjacent characters. Answer B, on the other hand, discusses the use of Gaussian masks and multiple heads to capture information from different positions, highlighting improvements over standard multi-head self-attention for specific tasks. While both answers relate to Gaussian-masked directional attention, they emphasize different aspects and mechanisms. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent as they convey different information about how the attention mechanism operates."
