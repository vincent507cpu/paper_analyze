    "query": "Are the images from a specific domain?",
    "gold_answer": "YesYes",
    "predict": "Yes, images from a specific domain are captured by filters learned using different methods.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A simply confirms that the images are from a specific domain with a repetitive 'YesYes,' while Answer B provides a more detailed explanation about how these images are captured through filters and methods. Although both answers affirm that the images are from a specific domain, Answer B elaborates on the process, making the two answers semantically different in terms of detail and context. Therefore, they are not equivalent."
