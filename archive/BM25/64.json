    "query": "What was the conclusion of the study?",
    "gold_answer": "The conclusion was that fruit consumption may provide a protective effect for mercury exposure in Amazonian riparians.",
    "predict": "The conclusion of the study is that the use of bigrams as features based on their experiments on the data set yielded results similar to those obtained using gold standards. However, further investigation through extended versions of the data set may help verify this conclusion in future work.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a specific conclusion regarding the protective effect of fruit consumption against mercury exposure in a particular population. In contrast, Answer B discusses a different conclusion related to the use of bigrams as features in experiments, which is unrelated to the topic of fruit consumption or mercury exposure. Since the two answers address entirely different conclusions and subjects, they are not semantically equivalent."
