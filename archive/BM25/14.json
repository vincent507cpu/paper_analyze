    "query": "How is the function beta(r) determined in the derivation?",
    "gold_answer": "Using the vacuum Einstein equation and the Baez-Bunn form.",
    "predict": "The function \\(\\beta(r)\\) is determined by solving the differential equation:\n\\[\n\\beta(r)\\beta'(r) = \\frac{C}{r^2}\n\\]\nwith \\(C\\) being a constant. This relationship allows for the determination of \\(\\beta(r)\\), which then replaces \\(B(r)\\) in further calculations within Visser's derivation.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the function beta(r) is determined using the vacuum Einstein equation and the Baez-Bunn form, which implies a general approach to deriving the function. Answer B, on the other hand, provides a specific method involving a differential equation to determine beta(r). While both answers relate to the determination of beta(r), they describe different processes. Answer A is more abstract and does not provide the specific mathematical relationship mentioned in Answer B. Therefore, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
