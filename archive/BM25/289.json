    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A refers to 'the same datasets as BIBREF7,' which does not specify what those datasets are. Answer B explicitly mentions the 'publicly available FCE dataset' used for training error detection frameworks. Since Answer A lacks specificity and does not confirm that it refers to the FCE dataset mentioned in Answer B, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
