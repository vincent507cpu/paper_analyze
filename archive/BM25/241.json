    "predict": "The five baselines they compared against were:\n\n1. CRAFT: BIBREF9 based on pragmatic features in the first comment-reply pair\n2. Awry: state-of-the-art method proposed in BIBREF9 using pragmatic features\n3. BoW: simple bag-of-words baseline using TF-IDF weighted bag-of-words features from BIBREF9\n4. Enc-Dec: a two-step encoder-decoder model with ingredient attention (with comparable performance and lower complexity)\n5. name-based Nearest-Neighbor model (NN): Neural Checklist Model of BIBREF0",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a comprehensive list of various neural network models and specific baselines used for comparison, focusing on tree-structured and non-tree models. In contrast, Answer B lists five specific baselines, each with a brief description, but does not mention any of the models or baselines referenced in Answer A. The two answers address different sets of baselines and do not overlap in content or context, indicating that they are not semantically equivalent."
