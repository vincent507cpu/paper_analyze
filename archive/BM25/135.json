    "query": "How does their model improve interpretability compared to softmax transformers?",
    "gold_answer": "the attention heads in the proposed adaptively sparse Transformer can specialize more and with higher confidenceWe introduce sparse attention into the Transformer architecture",
    "predict": "Their model uses sparse normalizing transforms in attention mechanisms like sparsemax instead of softmax to improve performance and interpretability. This approach yields exactly zero probabilities for irrelevant words, potentially improving performance and making it easier to understand the context-dependent weights.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A discusses the specialization and confidence of attention heads in the proposed model, mentioning sparse attention but lacks detail on how it specifically improves interpretability compared to softmax transformers. Answer B, on the other hand, explicitly states that the model uses sparse normalizing transforms like sparsemax instead of softmax, detailing how this change leads to zero probabilities for irrelevant words, which directly contributes to both performance and interpretability. While both answers touch on the concept of sparse attention, Answer B provides a clearer and more comprehensive explanation of how interpretability is improved, making them not semantically equivalent."
