    "query": "What is the main methodology used in the research?",
    "gold_answer": "An unsupervised method based on the information bottleneck and contrastive learning.",
    "predict": "The main methodology used in the research is based on BIBREF7.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A specifies an unsupervised method that involves the information bottleneck and contrastive learning, detailing the specific techniques used in the research. Answer B, however, refers to a methodology based on 'BIBREF7,' which appears to be a reference or citation rather than a description of the methodology itself. Since Answer A provides a clear explanation of the methodology while Answer B does not clarify what BIBREF7 entails, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
