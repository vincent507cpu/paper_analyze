    "query": "How effective is their NCEL approach overall?",
    "gold_answer": "NCEL consistently outperforms various baselines with a favorable generalization ability",
    "predict": "The NCEL approach is effective overall, as evidenced by significant improvements in machine learning models such as LR (5.17% and 18.38%) and MLP (10.71% and 30.27%) on average, demonstrating enhanced performance with the target models generally converging after 7-9 iterations on both datasets. The approach also outperforms mBERT in cross-lingual zero-shot tasks when using BERT as a starting point.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a general statement about the NCEL approach's effectiveness, indicating that it consistently outperforms various baselines and has good generalization ability. Answer B, on the other hand, offers specific quantitative evidence of the NCEL approach's effectiveness, detailing improvements in specific machine learning models and performance metrics. While both answers affirm the effectiveness of the NCEL approach, Answer B provides a more detailed and evidence-based explanation. However, the core assertion of effectiveness is present in both answers, making them semantically equivalent in the context of the query, albeit with differing levels of detail."
