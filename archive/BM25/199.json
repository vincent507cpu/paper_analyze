    "gold_answer": "Women represent 33.16% of the speakers",
    "predict": "The question \"How big is imbalance in analyzed corpora?\" implies assessing the extent of class imbalance within the corpora being used for analysis. The content suggests that this is related to class imbalance problems and discusses potential solutions, including data augmentation methods like oversampling or undersampling minority classes, cost-sensitive learning techniques, and other common NER corpora handling strategies but notes that even the best baseline system in such a corpus achieves relatively low scores due to inherent difficulty of the task.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a specific statistic about the representation of women among speakers, indicating a numerical value that could suggest an imbalance. Answer B, however, discusses the concept of class imbalance in a broader context, mentioning various methods to address it without providing a specific measure of imbalance. While both answers relate to the topic of imbalance, they do not convey the same information or level of detail regarding the size of the imbalance. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
