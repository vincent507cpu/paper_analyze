    "query": "How does the framework capture the reduced-order dynamics?",
    "gold_answer": "By using a propagator in the latent space.",
    "predict": "The framework captures reduced-order dynamics by using complex-valued latent variables and treating them independently. This approach allows for interpretable latent dynamics while minimizing parameter requirements in the Small Data regime.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the framework captures reduced-order dynamics by using a propagator in the latent space, which is a general description of the method. Answer B provides a more detailed explanation, mentioning the use of complex-valued latent variables and the benefits of this approach, such as interpretability and reduced parameter requirements. While both answers address the framework's method for capturing reduced-order dynamics, Answer B elaborates on the specifics and advantages, making it more informative but not semantically equivalent to Answer A, which lacks these details. Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent in meaning."
