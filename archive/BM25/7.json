    "query": "Can individual molecules of indeno[1,2-a]fluorene switch between open-shell and closed-shell states?",
    "gold_answer": "Yes, individual molecules of indeno[1,2-a]fluorene can switch between open-shell and closed-shell states by changing their adsorption site on the surface.",
    "predict": "Yes, individual molecules of indeno[1,2-a]fluorene can switch between open-shell and closed-shell states.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Both Answer A and Answer B affirm that individual molecules of indeno[1,2-a]fluorene can switch between open-shell and closed-shell states. However, Answer A provides additional context by mentioning that this switching occurs through changing their adsorption site on the surface, while Answer B does not include this detail. Despite this difference in specificity, the core assertion that the switching is possible remains the same in both answers, making them semantically equivalent in the context of the query."
