    "query": "What is the rationality coefficient used in the observation model?",
    "gold_answer": "γh.",
    "predict": "The rationality coefficient θ in the observation model represents the path preference for selecting the lowest cost action with the highest probability. This choice ensures that the human will always make the cheapest actions with the highest likelihood of success, which is assumed to be based on a prior belief about the costs and the probabilities associated with each action.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a specific symbol 'γh' as the rationality coefficient, while Answer B elaborates on the concept of the rationality coefficient θ, describing its role and implications in the observation model. The two answers refer to different symbols (γh vs. θ) and convey different levels of detail about the rationality coefficient. Since they do not refer to the same symbol and provide different information, they are not semantically equivalent."
