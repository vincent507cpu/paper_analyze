    "query": "What is the potential of SNNs in modeling the visual system?",
    "gold_answer": "SNNs have the potential to better model and explain the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system.",
    "predict": "SNNs (Super Networks Neural) have potential in modeling the visual system.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A elaborates on the potential of SNNs by stating they can better model and explain the functional hierarchy and mechanisms of the visual system, indicating a deeper understanding of their capabilities. Answer B, while mentioning that SNNs have potential in modeling the visual system, does not provide specific details about what aspects of the visual system they can model or explain. The lack of specificity in Answer B compared to the detailed explanation in Answer A means that the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
