    "query": "What are the network's baseline features?",
    "gold_answer": " The features extracted from CNN.",
    "predict": "Baseline features dominate over pre-trained features for sarcasm detection. Baseline features learn most of the global and contextual features learned by pre-trained networks.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the baseline features are 'the features extracted from CNN,' which is a specific reference to a type of neural network. Answer B, however, discusses the relationship between baseline features and pre-trained features in the context of sarcasm detection, indicating that baseline features encompass global and contextual features learned by pre-trained networks. While both answers mention baseline features, Answer A is more specific and does not provide the broader context or comparison that Answer B does. Therefore, they do not convey the same meaning regarding the network's baseline features."
