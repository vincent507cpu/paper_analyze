    "predict": "The baselines were compared using a set of well-known methods on datasets for testing.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific models and methods related to baselines in a technical context, while Answer B provides a general statement about comparing baselines using well-known methods. Answer A is focused on the specific baselines themselves, whereas Answer B discusses the process of comparison without detailing what those baselines are. Therefore, the two answers do not convey the same information and are not semantically equivalent."
