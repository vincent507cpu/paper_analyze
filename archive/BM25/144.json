    "predict": "BLEU score, contrastive evaluation of translation of several discourse phenomena, human evaluation.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists a comprehensive set of specific metrics used for evaluation, including various scoring methods and their definitions, while Answer B provides a more general overview of evaluation methods without specific metrics. The two answers do not cover the same metrics or evaluation methods, and thus are not semantically equivalent. Answer A is detailed and specific, whereas Answer B is vague and lacks the same level of detail."
