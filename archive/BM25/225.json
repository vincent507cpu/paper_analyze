    "query": "what accents are present in the corpus?",
    "gold_answer": "UnanswerableUnanswerable",
    "predict": "The corpus contains various accents.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'UnanswerableUnanswerable,' indicating that the question cannot be answered, while Answer B provides a specific response about the presence of various accents in the corpus. Since one answer claims that the question cannot be answered and the other provides an answer, they are not semantically equivalent."
