    "gold_answer": "0.51150.6103",
    "predict": "Their highest MRR score was achieved in the third test batch set of Factoid Question Answering task.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a numerical value (0.51150.6103) as the highest MRR score, while Answer B describes a context in which the highest MRR score was achieved, specifically mentioning the third test batch set of a task. The two answers do not convey the same information; Answer A gives a specific score, whereas Answer B provides contextual information without stating the score itself. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
