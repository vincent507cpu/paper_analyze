    "query": "What types of sensors are now capable of estimating physical activity levels and physiological outcomes of older adults?",
    "gold_answer": "Wearable sensors.",
    "predict": "Physical and physiological sensors are capable of estimating physical activity levels and physiological outcomes in older adults.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A specifies 'wearable sensors' as the type of sensors capable of estimating physical activity levels and physiological outcomes. Answer B, on the other hand, refers to 'physical and physiological sensors' without specifying that they are wearable. While both answers address sensors that can estimate activity levels and outcomes for older adults, Answer B is broader and includes types of sensors that may not be wearable. Therefore, the two answers are not semantically equivalent as they refer to different categories of sensors."
