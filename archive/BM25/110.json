    "gold_answer": "O(t, L_{\\parallel}; S_\\Delta) = L_{\\parallel}^{-\\beta/[\\nu(1+\\Delta)]} \\tilde f_O(t/L_{\\parallel}^{z/(1+\\Delta)}; S_\\Delta).",
    "predict": "The scaling form for the alternative order parameter O is not specified directly in the given content. The text does not mention anything about scaling parameters for O specifically.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a specific mathematical expression for the scaling form of the alternative order parameter O, detailing its dependence on various parameters. In contrast, Answer B states that the scaling form is not specified and implies that no information is provided about it. Since Answer A gives a concrete definition while Answer B denies the existence of such a definition, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
