    "query": "How does the transition probability of the environment affect the learning rate in the static agent?",
    "gold_answer": "As the transition probability increases, the learning rate initially rises and then declines.",
    "predict": "The transition probability of the environment affects the learning rate by influencing when and where agents learn. When environmental transitions are very rare, the agent opts for a lower learning rate to converge slowly but safely in each environment, ensuring low loss while staying in that environment. As the likelihood of transitioning increases, faster learning is needed to speed up convergence within environments due to more frequent exposure over shorter stays.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a general statement about the relationship between transition probability and learning rate, indicating an initial increase followed by a decline. Answer B elaborates on this relationship by explaining the mechanisms behind the learning rate adjustments based on transition probabilities, detailing how agents adapt their learning strategies in response to environmental changes. While both answers discuss the effect of transition probability on learning rate, Answer B offers a more nuanced explanation, but they do not contradict each other. However, they do not express the same idea in a directly equivalent manner. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
