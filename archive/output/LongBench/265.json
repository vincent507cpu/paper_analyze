    "query": "How are weights dynamically adjusted?",
    "gold_answer": "One can think $(1-p_{i1})$ as a weight associated with each example, which changes as training proceeds. The intuition of changing $p_{i1}$ to $(1-p_{i1}) p_{i1}$ is to push down the weight of easy examples. For easy examples whose probability are approaching 0 or 1, $(1-p_{i1}) p_{i1}$ makes the model attach significantly less focus to them. Figure FIGREF23 gives gives an explanation from the perspective in derivative: the derivative of $\\frac{(1-p)p}{1+(1-p)p}$ with respect to $p$ approaches 0 immediately after $p$ approaches 0, which means the model attends less to examples once they are correctly classified.associates each training example with a weight in proportion to $(1-p)$, and this weight dynamically changes as training proceeds",
    "predict": "Weights are dynamically adjusted based on performance on the development set rather than directly using class proportions from the training data. This strategy helps to deemphasize confident examples and makes the model attentive to hard-negative examples.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A discusses the dynamic adjustment of weights in relation to the probabilities of examples being classified correctly, emphasizing how weights change during training to focus less on easy examples. Answer B, on the other hand, describes a different approach to weight adjustment based on performance on a development set, aiming to reduce emphasis on confident examples. While both answers address the concept of dynamic weight adjustment, they describe different mechanisms and strategies, indicating that they are not semantically equivalent."
