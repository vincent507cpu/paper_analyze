    "query": "How effective is their NCEL approach overall?",
    "gold_answer": "NCEL consistently outperforms various baselines with a favorable generalization ability",
    "predict": "Overall effective.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed assessment of the NCEL approach, stating that it consistently outperforms various baselines and has favorable generalization ability, which implies a high level of effectiveness. Answer B, on the other hand, simply states that it is 'overall effective,' which is a vague and less informative assertion. While both answers suggest a positive evaluation of the NCEL approach, Answer A offers specific evidence of effectiveness, making it more comprehensive. Therefore, the two answers are not semantically equivalent as they convey different levels of detail and certainty regarding effectiveness."
