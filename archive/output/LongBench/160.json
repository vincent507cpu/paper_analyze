    "query": "What neural network modules are included in NeuronBlocks?",
    "gold_answer": "Embedding Layer, Neural Network Layers, Loss Function, MetricsEmbedding Layer, Neural Network Layers, Loss Function, Metrics",
    "predict": "NeuronBlocks includes two neural network modules: the Model Zoo and the Block Zoo.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific components of NeuronBlocks, including 'Embedding Layer,' 'Neural Network Layers,' 'Loss Function,' and 'Metrics.' In contrast, Answer B refers to broader categories, 'Model Zoo' and 'Block Zoo,' which do not directly correspond to the specific modules mentioned in Answer A. Since the answers provide different information about the modules included in NeuronBlocks, they are not semantically equivalent."
