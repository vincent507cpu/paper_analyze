    "predict": "Yes, they employ their indexing-based method to create a sample of a QA Wikipedia dataset for evaluation purposes.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a vague response 'YesNo,' which does not clearly affirm or deny the use of the indexing-based method. Answer B explicitly states that they do employ the method to create a sample of a QA Wikipedia dataset for evaluation purposes.
