    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed list of specific models and features related to the query about baselines, while Answer B simply states 'Baselines,' which does not provide any information or context. Since Answer A elaborates on what the baselines are, and Answer B does not provide any meaningful content related to the query, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
