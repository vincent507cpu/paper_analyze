    "query": "Which basic neural architecture perform best by itself?",
    "gold_answer": "BERT",
    "predict": "The neural architecture that uses multitask learning performs best by itself.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A identifies 'BERT' as a specific neural architecture, while Answer B refers to a general category of architectures that utilize multitask learning. Since BERT is a specific instance of a neural architecture and multitask learning can encompass various architectures, the two answers do not convey the same meaning. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
