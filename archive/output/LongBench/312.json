    "query": "How do the authors evidence the claim that many engineers find it a big overhead to choose from multiple frameworks, models and optimization techniques?",
    "gold_answer": "By conducting a survey among engineersUnanswerable",
    "predict": "The authors evidence this claim through examples demonstrating that when parts of the task formulation are removed or model complexity is restricted, models still perform comparably to state-of-the-art techniques. This suggests that the benchmark complexity perceived as high by engineers can be alleviated without significantly harming performance.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the authors evidence the claim by conducting a survey among engineers, which implies a method of data collection. However, it is marked as 'Unanswerable,' indicating that it does not provide a valid or complete response. Answer B, on the other hand, provides a detailed explanation of how the authors support their claim through specific examples related to model complexity and performance. Since Answer A does not provide a coherent or relevant explanation, while Answer B does, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
