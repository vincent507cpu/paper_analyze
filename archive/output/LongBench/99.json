    "query": "Who was Ralph Rokebye's brother?",
    "gold_answer": "Sir Richard.",
    "predict": "William",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A identifies Ralph Rokebye's brother as 'Sir Richard,' while Answer B states 'William.' Since both answers refer to different individuals, they cannot be semantically equivalent. The question specifically asks for the name of one brother, and the two answers provided are distinct names, indicating that they refer to different people."
