    "query": "How much higher quality is the resulting annotated data?",
    "gold_answer": "improvement when the difficult subset with expert annotations is mixed with the remaining crowd annotation is 3.5 F1 score, much larger than when a random set of expert annotations are added",
    "predict": "The resulting annotated data has a much higher quality compared to randomly selecting the data for expert annotators. The average F1 score of the annotations is 0.82, indicating that more than two-thirds of the overall labels are agreed upon by both experts and crowd annotators. This level of agreement suggests satisfactory annotation quality, considering the complexity of the schema.\n\nThere is a slight performance difference between random sampling and selecting annotated data from experts, but this difference appears to be due primarily to variations in annotation quality rather than inherent differences in annotation methods. The higher average F1 score for expert annotations further supports their superior quality compared to crowd annotations on difficult instances.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a specific quantitative improvement (3.5 F1 score) when expert annotations are mixed with crowd annotations, indicating a clear measure of quality enhancement. Answer B discusses the overall quality of the resulting annotated data, mentioning an average F1 score of 0.82 and the level of agreement between experts and crowd annotators. While both answers address the quality of annotated data, they focus on different aspects: Answer A emphasizes the improvement from a specific method, while Answer B provides a broader context of quality assessment. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent as they do not convey the same information about the quality of the annotated data."
