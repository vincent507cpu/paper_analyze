    "predict": "The ML methods aim to identify argument components based on several linguistic features including n-grams, structural features, syntactic features, topic distribution, sentiment distribution, semantic features, coreference features, discourse features, and word embeddings.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific components of an argument, such as claim, premise, backing, rebuttal, and refutation. In contrast, Answer B describes the methods used by ML to identify argument components, focusing on various linguistic features. The two answers address different aspects of the query: Answer A provides a direct list of components, while Answer B discusses the features used to identify those components. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
