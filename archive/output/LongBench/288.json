    "query": "How many layers does the UTCNN model have?",
    "gold_answer": "eight layers",
    "predict": "6",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the UTCNN model has 'eight layers,' while Answer B states it has '6.' The two answers provide different numerical values for the number of layers in the model. Since 'eight' and '6' are distinct quantities, they cannot be considered semantically equivalent in this context."
