    "query": "What kind of ultracold neutral plasmas does this study focus on?",
    "gold_answer": "A subset that form via kinetic rate processes from state-selected Rydberg gases.",
    "predict": "Ultracold neutral plasmas formed from state-selected Rydberg gases.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A specifies that the ultracold neutral plasmas are a subset that forms via kinetic rate processes from state-selected Rydberg gases. Answer B states that these plasmas are formed from state-selected Rydberg gases without mentioning the kinetic rate processes. While both answers refer to ultracold neutral plasmas formed from state-selected Rydberg gases, Answer A provides additional detail about the formation process, which makes it more specific. However, the core information about the type of ultracold neutral plasmas remains the same in both answers, indicating they are semantically equivalent in the context of the query."
