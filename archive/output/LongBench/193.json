    "query": "On top of BERT does the RNN layer work better or the transformer layer?",
    "gold_answer": "Transformer over BERT (ToBERT)The transformer layer",
    "predict": "The transformer layer works better on top of BERT in tasks that require syntax sensitivity compared to RNN models (like LSTM).",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the transformer layer is used on top of BERT, but it does not provide any context or comparison. Answer B elaborates that the transformer layer works better than RNN models (like LSTM) on top of BERT, specifically in tasks requiring syntax sensitivity. While both answers mention the transformer layer, Answer B provides additional context and a comparison that Answer A lacks. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent as Answer A is vague and lacks the comparative aspect present in Answer B."
