    "gold_answer": "by training an autocomplete system on 500K randomly sampled sentences from Yelp reviewsefficiency of a communication scheme $(q_{\\alpha },p_{\\beta })$ by the retention rate of tokens, which is measured as the fraction of tokens that are kept in the keywords, accuracy of a scheme is measured as the fraction of sentences generated by greedily decoding the model that exactly matches the target sentence",
    "predict": "In the human-machine communication game, models are evaluated using probing methodologies and modeling techniques.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed explanation of how models are evaluated, mentioning specific methods such as training an autocomplete system and measuring retention rates and accuracy. Answer B, however, gives a more general statement about using probing methodologies and modeling techniques without specifying what those entail. The two answers do not convey the same level of detail or the same specific evaluation methods, indicating that they are not semantically equivalent."
