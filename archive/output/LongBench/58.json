    "query": "How does the receptive field size affect the completion of shapes?",
    "gold_answer": "Bigger receptive field size leads to more successful shape completion.",
    "predict": "The bigger the receptive field size, the more complete shapes can be reconstructed using DSP.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that a bigger receptive field size leads to more successful shape completion, while Answer B specifies that a larger receptive field allows for more complete shapes to be reconstructed using DSP (Digital Signal Processing). Both answers convey the idea that an increase in receptive field size positively impacts the ability to complete or reconstruct shapes. Although Answer B adds a specific context (DSP), the core concept of improved shape completion due to a larger receptive field is maintained in both answers, making them semantically equivalent."
