    "query": "Is Arabic one of the 11 languages in CoVost?",
    "gold_answer": "NoNo",
    "predict": "No.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'NoNo,' which appears to be a typographical error or a concatenation of 'No' repeated. Answer B states 'No,' which is a clear and grammatically correct response. Despite the difference in presentation, both answers convey the same meaning: that Arabic is not one of the 11 languages in CoVost. Therefore, they can be considered semantically equivalent in this context."
