    "query": "Does their NER model learn NER from both text and images?",
    "gold_answer": "YesYes",
    "predict": "Yes, their NER model learns NER from both text and images.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'YesYes,' which appears to be a typographical error or a concatenation of 'Yes' without proper spacing or punctuation. Answer B provides a clear and complete affirmation that the NER model learns from both text and images. While both answers indicate a positive response, Answer A lacks clarity and proper structure, making it less semantically equivalent to Answer B."
