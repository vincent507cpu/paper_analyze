    "query": "What is the average magnetic moment per column in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$ films?",
    "gold_answer": "1425 $\\mu_{B}$.",
    "predict": "The average magnetic moment per column is determined for each concentration range mentioned. For 2.3% and 4%, it's not specified, but 7%, 9%, and 11.3% concentrations show specific values which are necessary to provide the average magnetic moment per column information accurately.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a specific numerical value for the average magnetic moment per column in Ge$_1-x$Mn$_x$ films, while Answer B discusses the determination of the average magnetic moment based on different concentration ranges without providing a specific value. Since Answer A gives a concrete answer, whereas Answer B is more descriptive and lacks a definitive average magnetic moment, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
