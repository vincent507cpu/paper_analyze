    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'No,' indicating that the answered questions do not measure the usefulness of the answers. In contrast, Answer B asserts 'Yes,' claiming that the answered questions do measure the usefulness of the answers. Since these two answers provide opposing views on the same question, they are not semantically equivalent."
