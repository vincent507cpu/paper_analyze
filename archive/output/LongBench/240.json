    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific tasks where the conflict method is tested, namely 'Quora Duplicate Question Pair Detection' and 'Ranking questions in Bing's People Also Ask.' In contrast, Answer B describes the nature of the tasks as having 'contradicting relationships' but does not specify any particular tasks. Since Answer A gives concrete examples while Answer B speaks in general terms about the type of tasks, they do not convey the same information and are therefore not semantically equivalent."
