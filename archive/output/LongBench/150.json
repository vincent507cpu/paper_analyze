    "query": "LDA is an unsupervised method; is this paper introducing an unsupervised approach to spam detection?",
    "gold_answer": "NoNo",
    "predict": "Yes, this paper introduces an unsupervised approach to spam detection using LDA model for topic-based feature extraction.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'NoNo,' which suggests a denial of the introduction of an unsupervised approach to spam detection. In contrast, Answer B affirms that the paper does introduce an unsupervised approach using the LDA model. Since the two answers convey opposite meanings regarding the introduction of an unsupervised method, they are not semantically equivalent."
