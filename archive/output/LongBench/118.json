    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists a series of Facebook pages, but it contains a repetition of the same list, which does not add any new information. Answer B provides a similar list but omits some pages that are present in Answer A, specifically 'Disney' and 'DisneyFoxNews.' Since Answer A includes all the pages mentioned in Answer B plus additional ones, they are not semantically equivalent because Answer B does not encompass all the information provided in Answer A."
