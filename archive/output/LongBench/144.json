    "predict": "Human evaluation scores.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists a comprehensive set of specific metrics used for evaluation, including various quantitative measures like BLEU and ROUGE scores, as well as user matching accuracy and mean reciprocal rank. In contrast, Answer B simply states 'Human evaluation scores,' which refers to a qualitative assessment rather than the specific metrics mentioned in Answer A. Since the two answers refer to different types of evaluation metrics—one being quantitative and detailed, and the other qualitative and vague—they are not semantically equivalent."
