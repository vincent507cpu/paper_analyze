    "query": "Did they experiment with this new dataset?",

    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'No,' indicating that they did not experiment with the new dataset. In contrast, Answer B states 'Yes, they experimented with this new dataset,' which directly contradicts Answer A. Since the two answers provide opposing responses to the same question, they are not semantically equivalent."
