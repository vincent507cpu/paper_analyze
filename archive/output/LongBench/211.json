    "query": "What is the invertibility condition?",
    "gold_answer": "The neural projector must be invertible.we constrain our neural projector with two requirements: (1) INLINEFORM0 and (2) INLINEFORM1 exists",
    "predict": "The invertibility condition is an important requirement for the neural projector in order to address optimization challenges effectively.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific conditions for the invertibility of the neural projector, mentioning two requirements (INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1) that must be satisfied. Answer B, on the other hand, states that the invertibility condition is important for addressing optimization challenges but does not specify any conditions or requirements. While both answers discuss the importance of invertibility for the neural projector, they do so in different contexts and with different levels of specificity. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
