    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific quantitative details about the corpus, stating it contains 8,275 sentences and 167,739 words. Answer B, however, describes the corpus in terms of document clusters and topics, focusing on the structure and average token count rather than the total number of sentences and words. Since the two answers address different aspects of the corpus and do not provide equivalent information regarding its size, they are not semantically equivalent."
