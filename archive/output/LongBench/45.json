    "query": "What is the dynamical behavior of the anisotropic order parameter following a quench to the critical point?",
    "gold_answer": "It is well described by the Gaussian theory.",
    "predict": "The dynamical behavior of the anisotropic order parameter \\( m \\) following a quench to the critical point is well described by simulations that account for finite β effects and higher-order gauge corrections.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the dynamical behavior is well described by the Gaussian theory, which is a specific theoretical framework. Answer B, however, provides a more detailed explanation, mentioning simulations that consider finite β effects and higher-order gauge corrections. While both answers address the dynamical behavior of the anisotropic order parameter, they do so from different perspectives and levels of detail. Answer A is more general, while Answer B is specific and includes additional factors. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
