    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists various quantitative evaluation metrics commonly used in tasks such as information retrieval and natural language processing, while Answer B refers to a qualitative assessment method involving human judgment. Since the two answers describe fundamentally different approaches to evaluation—one being metric-based and the other being human-centric—they are not semantically equivalent."
