    "query": "What is the electron correlation parameter, $\\Gamma_e$?",
    "gold_answer": "It is the ratio of the average unscreened electron-electron potential energy to kinetic energy.",
    "predict": "The electron correlation parameter, $\\Gamma_e$, is given by the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma_e = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 a_{ws}}\\frac{1}{k_B T_e}\n\\]\n\nwhere $a_{ws}$ represents the work function scale width.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a qualitative description of the electron correlation parameter, $\\Gamma_e$, stating that it is a ratio of potential energy to kinetic energy. Answer B, on the other hand, gives a specific mathematical expression for $\\Gamma_e$, including variables and constants. While both answers relate to the concept of electron correlation, they do not convey the same information; Answer A is a general description, while Answer B is a precise formula. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
