    "predict": "Our Dataset",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed description of the datasets used, including specific types of data such as user questions, documents, Twitter posts, and news articles related to finance, as well as a self-collected financial intents dataset in Portuguese. Answer B, on the other hand, simply states 'Our Dataset,' which lacks any specific information about the datasets being used. Since Answer B does not provide any details that correspond to the information in Answer A, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
