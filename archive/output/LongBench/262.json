    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific baselines used for evaluation, directly addressing the query. In contrast, Answer B does not provide any relevant information about the baselines and instead comments on the lack of context and repetition in the text. Since Answer B fails to answer the question and does not relate to the content of Answer A, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
