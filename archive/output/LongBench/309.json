    "query": "Do they evaluate only on English datasets?",
    "gold_answer": "YesUnanswerable",
    "predict": "Yes, they evaluate only on English datasets.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'YesUnanswerable,' which seems to imply a positive response but adds the term 'Unanswerable,' suggesting that the question cannot be definitively answered. Answer B clearly states 'Yes, they evaluate only on English datasets,' providing a straightforward affirmation. The addition of 'Unanswerable' in Answer A creates ambiguity and changes the meaning, making the two answers semantically different."
