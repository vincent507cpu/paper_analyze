    "query": "What is the improvement in performance for Estonian in the NER task?",
    "gold_answer": "5 percent points.0.05 F1",
    "predict": "10%",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states an improvement of '5 percent points' and '0.05 F1,' which indicates a specific numerical increase in performance. Answer B states '10%,' which suggests a different level of improvement. Since 5 percent points and 10% represent different values of performance improvement, they are not semantically equivalent."
