    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific details about the datasets used, including the ERP data from Frank et al. (2015) and behavioral data from Frank et al. (2013). In contrast, Answer B simply states 'Our Dataset,' which lacks any specific information about the datasets. Since Answer B does not provide any details that correspond to the datasets mentioned in Answer A, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
