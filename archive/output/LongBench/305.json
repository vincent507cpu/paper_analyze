    "query": "How larger are the training sets of these versions of ELMo compared to the previous ones?",
    "gold_answer": "By 14 times.up to 1.95 times larger",
    "predict": "The training sets for these versions of ELMo are larger compared to the previous ones. Specifically:\n\n- For English language ELMo (ELMoForManyLangs), it was trained on a one billion word large corpus with an about 800,000-word vocabulary file.\n- For other languages and languages like Finnish, Slovenian, etc., it also uses larger datasets due to more resources. \n\nSo these versions have training sets significantly larger than the previous ones.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a specific quantitative comparison, stating that the training sets are 'by 14 times' and 'up to 1.95 times larger,' which gives a clear numerical context. Answer B, on the other hand, describes the training sets as 'larger' without providing specific numerical values, but it elaborates on the size of the datasets used for different languages. While both answers indicate that the training sets are larger, Answer A gives a precise measurement, whereas Answer B provides qualitative information about the datasets. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent as one is specific and the other is general."
