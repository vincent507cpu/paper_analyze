    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed list of specific baseline models that strong baselines are compared to, while Answer B simply states 'Strong baselines' without any additional context or information. The two answers do not convey the same information; Answer A is specific and informative, whereas Answer B is vague and does not address the query adequately. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
