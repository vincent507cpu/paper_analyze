    "query": "Is there any evidence of heaven and hell?",
    "gold_answer": "Unknown.",
    "predict": "There are no explicit evidence of heaven and hell in the provided content.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'Unknown,' indicating a lack of definitive evidence regarding heaven and hell. Answer B elaborates that 'there are no explicit evidence of heaven and hell in the provided content,' which also conveys a lack of evidence but provides more context. While both answers suggest uncertainty about the existence of evidence, Answer B is more specific in its phrasing. However, both ultimately communicate the same idea of absence of evidence, making them semantically equivalent in this context."
