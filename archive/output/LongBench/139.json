    "query": "What kind of stylistic features are obtained?",
    "gold_answer": "Unanswerable",
    "predict": "Linguistic, Layout, and Topical Features",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'Unanswerable,' indicating that the question cannot be answered, while Answer B provides specific examples of stylistic features: 'Linguistic, Layout, and Topical Features.' Since one answer suggests that there is no answer to the question and the other provides concrete information, they are not semantically equivalent."
