    "predict": "The annotated clinical notes were obtained from the CE task in 2010 i2b2/VA.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a fragment of information about the source of the annotated clinical notes, while Answer B presents a complete sentence that clearly states the source. Both answers refer to the same source, 'the CE task in 2010 i2b2/VA,' but Answer A is less clear and somewhat repetitive. Despite this, they convey the same essential information regarding the origin of the clinical notes, making them semantically equivalent."
