    "query": "Is SemCor3.0 reflective of English language data in general?",
    "gold_answer": "YesUnanswerable",
    "predict": "No, SemCor3.0 is not reflective of English language data in general.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'YesUnanswerable,' which suggests that the question cannot be definitively answered with a 'yes' or 'no.' Answer B provides a clear 'no' response, indicating that SemCor3.0 is not reflective of English language data in general. Since one answer implies uncertainty while the other provides a definitive negation, they are not semantically equivalent."
