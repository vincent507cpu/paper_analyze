    "predict": "Yes, they report results on English data only.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'Unanswerable,' indicating that the question cannot be answered definitively. Answer B provides a clear response affirming that results are reported only on English data. Since one answer suggests that the question cannot be answered while the other provides a specific answer, they are not semantically equivalent."
