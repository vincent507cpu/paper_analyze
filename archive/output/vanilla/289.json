    "reasoning": "Answer A refers to 'the same datasets as BIBREF7,' indicating a specific reference to datasets used in another work, while Answer B describes the dataset as 'Our Dataset,' which suggests a unique dataset created or defined by the authors of the paper. Since Answer A does not specify the dataset used in the paper and instead references another source, and Answer B provides a distinct identification of the dataset, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
