    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed list of specific learning models used on the dataset, including Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks. In contrast, Answer B states that the learning models are unspecified, which directly contradicts the information provided in Answer A. Since one answer specifies the models while the other claims they are unspecified, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
