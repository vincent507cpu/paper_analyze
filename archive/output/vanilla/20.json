    "query": "What did the court in In re Ferguson conclude about the transformation prong of the Bilski test?",
    "gold_answer": "It required the transformation to be limited to specific data and a visual depiction representing specific objects or substances.",
    "predict": "The court in In re Ferguson concluded that the transformation prong of the Bilski test requires only the physical transformation of an article into something different from its unaltered state. It does not consider software or other categories of subject matter as transformative unless it specifically involves a machine.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the transformation must be limited to specific data and visual depictions of specific objects or substances, implying a narrow interpretation of the transformation prong. Answer B, however, describes a broader requirement for physical transformation, indicating that it does not consider software transformative unless it involves a machine. The two answers present different interpretations of the transformation prong, with Answer A focusing on specific data and visual representation, while Answer B emphasizes physical transformation without the same limitations. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
