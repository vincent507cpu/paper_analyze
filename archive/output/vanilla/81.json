    "query": "Who is responsible for carrying out the functions assigned under the act?",
    "gold_answer": "The Director of Town and Country Planning is responsible for carrying out the functions assigned under the act.",
    "predict": "The State Government is responsible for carrying out functions assigned under the act.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A specifies that 'The Director of Town and Country Planning' is responsible for the functions, while Answer B states that 'The State Government' holds this responsibility. These two entities are distinct; one is an individual position within a governmental framework, and the other refers to the broader governing body. Therefore, the answers are not semantically equivalent as they refer to different responsible parties."
