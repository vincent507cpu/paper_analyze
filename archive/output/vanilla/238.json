    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists various sentence embedding methods such as GloVe, BERT, and others, directly addressing the query about evaluated methods. Answer B, however, discusses an evaluation method (Supervised STS) rather than providing a list of sentence embedding methods. Since Answer B does not answer the query regarding the specific methods evaluated, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
