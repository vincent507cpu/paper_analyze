    "query": "Who were the experts used for annotation?",
    "gold_answer": "Individuals with legal trainingYes",
    "predict": "Experts were used for annotation.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A specifies 'Individuals with legal training' as the experts used for annotation, indicating a specific type of expertise. Answer B, however, is more general and states 'Experts were used for annotation' without specifying the type of experts. Since Answer A provides specific information about the qualifications of the experts while Answer B does not, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
