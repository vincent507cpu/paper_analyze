    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific NER tasks, while Answer B provides a general description of the evaluation focus, mentioning 'word analogy task' and 'named entity recognition (NER)' without specifying the eight tasks. Since Answer A provides concrete examples of the tasks evaluated, and Answer B does not match this specificity, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
