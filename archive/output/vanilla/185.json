    "query": "What is best performing model among author's submissions, what performance it had?",
    "gold_answer": "For SLC task, the \"ltuorp\" team  has the best performing  model (0.6323/0.6028/0.6649 for F1/P/R  respectively) and for FLC task the \"newspeak\" team  has the best performing  model (0.2488/0.2863/0.2201 for F1/P/R respectively).",
    "predict": "The best performing model according to validation performance was UPA, but its performance drops sharply on threads longer than 7 posts.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific details about the best performing models for two different tasks (SLC and FLC) along with their performance metrics. Answer B, however, mentions a different model (UPA) and discusses its performance in a different context (validation performance and thread length). Since the answers refer to different models and contexts, they are not semantically equivalent."
