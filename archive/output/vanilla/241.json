    "predict": "The content mentions \"baselines\" several times but does not provide specific names or details about which baselines were compared against. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the given text alone.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed list of various baselines, including specific models and their variants, directly addressing the query about which baselines were compared against. In contrast, Answer B states that the content mentions 'baselines' but fails to provide any specific names or details, indicating that it does not answer the question. Since Answer A directly answers the query while Answer B does not, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
