    "query": "Can the denoiser be applied to circuits with non-Clifford noise?",
    "gold_answer": "Yes, the denoiser works for non-Clifford local noise channels.",
    "predict": "No, the denoiser cannot be applied to circuits with non-Clifford noise.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the denoiser can be applied to non-Clifford local noise channels, indicating a positive capability. In contrast, Answer B explicitly states that the denoiser cannot be applied to circuits with non-Clifford noise, indicating a negative capability. Since the two answers provide opposite information regarding the applicability of the denoiser, they are not semantically equivalent."
