    "gold_answer": "Unanswerable",
    "predict": "They used morpho-syntactic features.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'Unanswerable,' indicating that the question cannot be answered based on the provided information. Answer B provides a specific answer, stating that 'they used morpho-syntactic features.' Since one answer claims that the question cannot be answered while the other provides a concrete answer, they are not semantically equivalent."
