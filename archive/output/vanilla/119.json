    "query": "Do the hashtag and SemEval datasets contain only English data?",
    "gold_answer": "YesYes",
    "predict": "No. The datasets contain only English data.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'YesYes,' which is an unclear and potentially erroneous affirmation regarding the datasets containing only English data. Answer B, however, states 'No. The datasets contain only English data,' which contradicts the assertion made in Answer A. Since one answer affirms the presence of only English data while the other denies it, they are not semantically equivalent."
