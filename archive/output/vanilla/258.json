    "gold_answer": "Dataset contains 3606 total sentences and 79087 total entities.ILPRL contains 548 sentences, OurNepali contains 3606 sentences",
    "predict": "The size of the dataset is not specified in the given content.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific details about the dataset, including the total number of sentences and entities, which directly addresses the query about the size of the dataset.

Since Answer A provides a clear size while Answer B denies that such information is available, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
