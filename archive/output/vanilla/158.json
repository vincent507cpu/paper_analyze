    "query": "What are the source and target domains?",
    "gold_answer": "Book, electronics, beauty, music, IMDB, Yelp, cell phone, baby, DVDs, kitchenwe use set 1 of the source domain as the only source with sentiment label information during training, and we evaluate the trained model on set 1 of the target domain, Book (BK), Electronics (E), Beauty (BT), and Music (M)",
    "predict": "Source domain: target domain  \nTarget domain: unknown",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed list of source and target domains, specifically mentioning various categories such as books, electronics, and music, along with a description of how they are used in training and evaluation. Answer B, however, only states 'Source domain: target domain' and 'Target domain: unknown,' which lacks specific information about what the source and target domains actually are. Since Answer A gives concrete examples and context while Answer B is vague and does not provide any meaningful information about the domains, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
