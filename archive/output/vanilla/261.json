    "predict": "Subjects were presented with results and discussion.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides specific details about the data presented to the subjects, including phonemic/syllabic sounds and specific words, which directly addresses the query about what data was used to elicit responses. In contrast, Answer B states that subjects were presented with 'results and discussion,' which does not specify any data related to the phonemic/syllabic sounds or words mentioned in Answer A. Therefore, the two answers are not semantically equivalent as they provide different types of information regarding the data presented to the subjects."
