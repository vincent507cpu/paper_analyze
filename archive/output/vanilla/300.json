    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A refers to a specific column in a table, indicating a location where scores can be found, while Answer B simply states 'scores,' which is a general term. Answer A does not directly provide the scores but rather points to where they can be found, making the two answers not semantically equivalent. Answer A is more about the context of the data, whereas Answer B is about the data itself."
