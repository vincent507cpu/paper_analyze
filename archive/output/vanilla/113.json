    "query": "What is the research opportunity that is mentioned?",
    "gold_answer": "A study on the effects of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and psychotherapy on people with autism.",
    "predict": "Data harvesting, building standardised datasets and shared tasks for South Africa as well as the rest of Africa.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A describes a specific research opportunity focused on the effects of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and psychotherapy on individuals with autism.
