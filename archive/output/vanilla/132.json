    "gold_answer": "a regularization term associated with neutral features, the maximum entropy of class distribution regularization term, the KL divergence between reference and predicted class distributiona regularization term associated with neutral features,  the maximum entropy of class distribution, KL divergence between reference and predicted class distribution",
    "predict": "Three regularization terms:  \n(1) Regularization associated with neutral features  \n(2) Maximum entropy class distribution regularization  \n(3) KL divergence between reference and predicted class distribution",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists the three regularization terms in a continuous format without clear separation, while Answer B explicitly enumerates and separates each term, making it clearer. However, both answers convey the same three concepts: regularization associated with neutral features, maximum entropy of class distribution, and KL divergence between reference and predicted class distribution. The differences in formatting do not change the semantic meaning of the terms described, thus they are semantically equivalent."
