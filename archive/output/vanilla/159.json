    "query": "what previous RNN models do they compare with?",
    "gold_answer": "Variational LSTM, CharCNN, Pointer Sentinel-LSTM, RHN, NAS Cell, SRU, QRNN, RAN, 4-layer skip-connection LSTM, AWD-LSTM, Quantized LSTM",
    "predict": "They compare with RNNs and neural network models. Specifically:\n- **RNN**: They mention comparing to \"uni-directional RNN\" and \"LSTM/RNN with LTC modules\".\n- **Neural Network Models (CNN)**: Compared with \"baseline CNN model\" and \"HybridCNN\".\n- **NMT Models**:\n  - Comparison was made with \"Transformer models\" vs. \"RNMT models\".\n  - Also compared with uni- and bi-directional versions of RNMT in some cases.\n- Traditional RNNs were compared to traditional architectures, mentioning the difference in how they process input word history versus each individual word.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific models that are compared, focusing on various RNN architectures and their variations. Answer B provides a broader overview, mentioning categories of models (RNNs and neural networks) and specific comparisons made within those categories. While both answers address comparisons with RNN models, Answer A is more specific and detailed, whereas Answer B is more general and includes additional types of models. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent as they convey different levels of specificity and detail regarding the comparisons."
