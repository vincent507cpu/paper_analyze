    "query": "How do they combine audio and text sequences in their RNN?",
    "gold_answer": "combines the information from these sources using a feed-forward neural modelencodes the information from audio and text sequences using dual RNNs and then combines the information from these sources using a feed-forward neural model",
    "predict": "They combine audio and text sequences by encoding MFCC features from the audio signal using GRUs (similar to LSTM), then concatenating this with prosodic features to form the final vector representation. This combined feature is passed through a fully connected neural network layer before being used as an input for further processing, such as generating simplified text sentences.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A describes a process of combining audio and text sequences using dual RNNs and a feed-forward neural model, but lacks specific details about the features being used. Answer B provides a more detailed explanation, mentioning the use of MFCC features and GRUs, as well as the concatenation with prosodic features and the subsequent processing steps. While both answers discuss combining audio and text sequences, they do so in different ways and with different levels of detail, indicating that they are not semantically equivalent."
