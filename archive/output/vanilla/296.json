    "query": "How does Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention works?",
    "gold_answer": "pays attentions to adjacent characters and casts a localness relationship between the characters as a fixed Gaussian weight assuming the weight relies on the distance between charactersGaussian-masked directional attention can be described as a function to map queries and key-value pairs to the representation of input, Gaussian-masked directional attention expects to pay attention to the adjacent characters of each positions and cast the localness relationship between characters as a fix Gaussian weight for attention, Gaussian weight only relys on the distance between characters",
    "predict": "Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention uses a Gaussian-weighted approach to capture relationships and attention for adjacent characters. It replaces the standard scaled dot-product mechanism with a fixed Gaussian weight that depends on character distances, enhancing focus on local neighborhood and position significance for character importance.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Both answers describe the concept of Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention, focusing on how it utilizes Gaussian weights to establish relationships between adjacent characters based on their distances. Answer A provides a more detailed explanation, mentioning the mapping of queries and key-value pairs, while Answer B succinctly summarizes the mechanism and its purpose. Despite the differences in detail and phrasing, both answers convey the same fundamental idea about the use of Gaussian weights for attention in a local context, making them semantically equivalent."
