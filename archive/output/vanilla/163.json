    "predict": "The languages used in their experiment are fusional, agglutinative, isolating, and introflexive.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific languages that are used in the experiment, while Answer B categorizes languages based on their grammatical features (fusional, agglutinative, isolating, and introflexive). The two answers provide different types of information: Answer A gives concrete examples of languages, whereas Answer B describes linguistic classifications. Since they address different aspects of language and do not convey the same information, they are not semantically equivalent."
