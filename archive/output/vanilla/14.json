    "query": "How is the function beta(r) determined in the derivation?",
    "gold_answer": "Using the vacuum Einstein equation and the Baez-Bunn form.",
    "predict": "The function \\(\\beta(r)\\) is determined by solving the differential equation:\n\n\\[\n\\beta\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\beta=C\\frac{\\mathrm{d} r}{r^2}\n\\]\n\nthrough separation of variables. This leads to integration, yielding:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\beta \\, d\\beta = C \\int \\frac{dr}{r^2}\n\\]\n\nThe solution for \\(\\beta(r)\\) is then obtained from these integrals.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a general method for determining the function \\(\beta(r)\\) by referencing the vacuum Einstein equation and the Baez-Bunn form, which implies a theoretical framework. Answer B, on the other hand, gives a specific mathematical procedure involving a differential equation and the steps to solve it through integration. While both answers relate to determining \\(\beta(r)\\), Answer A is more abstract and does not detail the process, whereas Answer B provides a concrete method. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent as they convey different levels of detail and approaches to the same concept."
