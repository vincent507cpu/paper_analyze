    "query": "What was their highest MRR score?",
    "gold_answer": "0.51150.6103",
    "predict": "0.637",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A presents a concatenated string of two numerical values, '0.51150.6103', which does not clearly represent a single MRR score. Answer B provides a distinct numerical value, '0.637'. Since Answer A does not convey a clear, singular MRR score and appears to be a combination of two different values, while Answer B is a specific score, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
