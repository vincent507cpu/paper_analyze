    "query": "Which natural language(s) are studied in this paper?",
    "gold_answer": "UnanswerableEnglish",
    "predict": "English",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'UnanswerableEnglish,' which appears to be a nonsensical or incorrect term, while Answer B simply states 'English.' Since Answer A does not provide a valid or recognizable natural language and Answer B clearly identifies 'English' as a language studied in the paper, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
