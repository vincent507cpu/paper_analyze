    "query": "Can someone sell or modify the Agency Spotter Content?",
    "gold_answer": "No.",
    "predict": "Yes, someone can sell or modify the Agency Spotter Content as long as they follow all relevant laws and guidelines.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'No,' indicating that selling or modifying the Agency Spotter Content is not allowed.
