    "query": "How is the political bias of different sources included in the model?",
    "gold_answer": "By assigning a political bias label to each news article and training only on left-biased or right-biased outlets of both disinformation and mainstream domainswe also account for political biases inherent to different news sources, referring to the procedure proposed in BIBREF2 to label different outlets. Overall we show that we are able to classify credible vs non-credible diffusion networks (and consequently news articles) with high accuracy (AUROC up to 94%), even when accounting for the political bias of sources (and training only on left-biased or right-biased articles). We observe that the layer of mentions alone conveys useful information for the classification, denoting a different usage of this functionality when sharing news belonging to the two news domains. We also show that most discriminative features, which are relative to the breadth and depth of largest cascades in different layers, are the same across the two countries.",
    "predict": "The political bias of different sources is included by assigning specific labels (left-biased/right-biased) to news outlets from mainstream and disinformation domains based on their reported political biases. The model then trains on these labeled data to classify credible vs non-credible diffusion networks/news articles.",
    "consistency": "1",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed explanation of how political bias is incorporated into the model, mentioning the training process and the accuracy achieved. Answer B summarizes the same process but in a more concise manner. Both answers convey the same core idea: that political bias is labeled and used for training the model to classify news articles. Therefore, they are semantically equivalent despite the difference in detail and length."
