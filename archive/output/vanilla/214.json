    "gold_answer": "Vanilla ST baseline, encoder pre-training, in which the ST encoder is initialized from an ASR model, decoder pre-training, in which the ST decoder is initialized from an MT model, encoder-decoder pre-training, where both the encoder and decoder are pre-trained, many-to-many multi-task model where the encoders and decoders are derived from pre-trained ASR and MT models, Triangle+pre-train: BIBREF18 DBLP:conf/naacl/AnastasopoulosC18 proposed a triangle multi-task strategy for speech translationVanilla ST baseline, Pre-training baselines, Multi-task baselines, Many-to-many+pre-training, Triangle+pre-trainVanilla ST baseline: The vanilla ST BIBREF9 has only a speech encoder and a decoder. It is trained from scratch on the ST-TED corpus.\n\nPre-training baselines: We conduct three pre-training baseline experiments: 1) encoder pre-training, in which the ST encoder is initialized from an ASR model; 2) decoder pre-training, in which the ST decoder is initialized from an MT model; and 3) encoder-decoder pre-training, where both the encoder and decoder are pre-trained. The ASR model has the same architecture with vanilla ST model, trained on the mixture of ST-TED and TED-LIUM2 corpus. The MT model has a text encoder and decoder with the same architecture of which in TCEN. It is first trained on WMT data (out-of-domain) and then fine-tuned on in-domain data.\n\nMulti-task baselines: We also conduct three multi-task baseline experiments including one-to-many setting, many-to-one setting, and many-to-many setting. In the first two settings, we train the model with $\\alpha _{st}=0.75$ while $\\alpha _{asr}=0.25$ or $\\alpha _{mt}=0.25$. For many-to-many setting, we use $\\alpha _{st}=0.6, \\alpha _{asr}=0.2$ and $\\alpha _{mt}=0.2$.. For MT task, we use only in-domain data.\n\nMany-to-many+pre-training: We train a many-to-many multi-task model where the encoders and decoders are derived from pre-trained ASR and MT models. ",
    "predict": "Baselines",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A provides a detailed and specific explanation of various types of baselines in the context of speech translation, including descriptions of different pre-training and multi-task strategies. Answer B, on the other hand, simply states 'Baselines,' which is a very general term and does not convey any specific information about the types or details of the baselines mentioned in Answer A. Therefore, the two answers are not semantically equivalent as they convey vastly different levels of detail and specificity regarding the query."
