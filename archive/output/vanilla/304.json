    "query": "What previous methods is their model compared to?",
    "gold_answer": "bag-of-words model, CNN",
    "predict": "Their model is compared to previous methods based on traditional machine learning classifiers and neural network-based models as described in the provided content. Specifically, they compare their performance against existing systems that are reported in literature for which results are directly referenced.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific models, 'bag-of-words model' and 'CNN,' as the methods for comparison. Answer B, however, provides a broader description of the comparison, mentioning 'traditional machine learning classifiers' and 'neural network-based models' without specifying which models are included. While both answers address the comparison of the model to previous methods, Answer A is more specific, whereas Answer B is more general and does not directly mention the same models. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent."
