    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific datasets used for evaluation, including CNN/DailyMail, New York Times Annotated Corpus, and XSum, which are all related to news and text summarization. Answer B, on the other hand, mentions different types of datasets, specifically sentence pairs and question pair datasets like SNLI, multiNLI, Quora, Clinical-QE, and SemEval-cQA, which are focused on natural language inference and question answering. Since the datasets mentioned in both answers serve different purposes and contexts, they are not semantically equivalent."
