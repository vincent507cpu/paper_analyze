    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A lists specific models used in the experiment, including linear SVM, BiLSTM, and CNN, while Answer B states that the models are not explicitly mentioned. Since Answer A provides concrete information about the models and Answer B denies that such information is available, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
