    "query": "What architecture does the encoder have?",
    "gold_answer": "LSTMLSTM",
    "predict": "Transformer architecture with encoder stacks and residual connections followed by layer normalization.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states 'LSTMLSTM,' which refers to a specific type of architecture based on Long Short-Term Memory networks. Answer B describes a 'Transformer architecture with encoder stacks and residual connections followed by layer normalization,' which is a fundamentally different architecture. Since LSTM and Transformer represent distinct approaches to encoding information in neural networks, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
