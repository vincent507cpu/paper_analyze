    "query": "What size chains were used in the benchmarking?",
    "gold_answer": "L = 8 and L = 14.",
    "predict": "0.6 chains",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A specifies two sizes of chains used in benchmarking, namely L = 8 and L = 14, indicating specific measurements. Answer B, however, provides a measurement of 0.6 chains, which does not correspond to the sizes mentioned in Answer A. Since the two answers refer to different measurements and do not convey the same information regarding the size of chains, they are not semantically equivalent."
