    "query": "What are the network's baseline features?",
    "gold_answer": " The features extracted from CNN.",
    "predict": "Network's baseline features are not explicitly mentioned in the provided content. The text \"Baselines\" is repeated multiple times but does not define what they refer to specifically about the network's features.",
    "consistency": "0",
    "reasoning": "Answer A states that the features are 'extracted from CNN,' which implies a specific source for the network's baseline features. Answer B, however, indicates that the network's baseline features are not explicitly defined in the content provided, suggesting a lack of information rather than a description of the features themselves. Since Answer A provides a specific detail about the source of the features while Answer B states that the features are not defined, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
