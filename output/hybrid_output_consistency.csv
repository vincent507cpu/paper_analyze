How is the political bias of different sources included in the model?,"By assigning a political bias label to each news article and training only on left-biased or right-biased outlets of both disinformation and mainstream domainswe also account for political biases inherent to different news sources, referring to the procedure proposed in BIBREF2 to label different outlets. Overall we show that we are able to classify credible vs non-credible diffusion networks (and consequently news articles) with high accuracy (AUROC up to 94%), even when accounting for the political bias of sources (and training only on left-biased or right-biased articles). We observe that the layer of mentions alone conveys useful information for the classification, denoting a different usage of this functionality when sharing news belonging to the two news domains. We also show that most discriminative features, which are relative to the breadth and depth of largest cascades in different layers, are the same across the two countries.","The political bias of different sources is included by learning parameters for ""INLINEFORM0"" and ""INLINEFORM1.""

Answer B, on the other hand, states that the sizes of both datasets are not explicitly stated and suggests referring to a table for the information. Since Answer A gives specific sizes while Answer B indicates that the sizes are not provided, the two answers are not semantically equivalent."
How does a media application determine the context of an event?,It uses a content-recognition module or algorithm.,A media application determines the context of an event by processing associated data using various content-recognition modules/algorithms. This involves analyzing spoken words and actions during and around the event to better understand its context.,1,"Answer A provides a general statement that a media application uses a content-recognition module or algorithm to determine the context of an event. Answer B elaborates on this by explaining that the application processes associated data and analyzes spoken words and actions to understand the context better. While both answers discuss the use of content-recognition modules/algorithms, Answer B provides more detail about the process involved. However, the core idea of using content-recognition for context determination remains consistent between the two answers, making them semantically equivalent in the context of the query."
What is the recommended daily intake of vitamin K for adult women and men?,90 μg for women and 120 μg for men.,The recommended daily intake of vitamin K for adult women and men is 120 μg.,0,"Answer A specifies the recommended daily intake of vitamin K as 90 μg for women and 120 μg for men, providing distinct values for each gender. Answer B states that the recommended daily intake is 120 μg, but it does not mention the intake for women. Since Answer B omits the specific value for women and only provides the value for men, the two answers are not semantically equivalent as they convey different information regarding the intake for both genders."
How large is the corpus?,"8,275 sentences and 167,739 words in totalThe corpus comprises 8,275 sentences and 167,739 words in total.",20-million token corpora is considered too small to train ELMo models for the word analogy task.,0,"Answer A provides specific quantitative details about the size of the corpus, stating it contains 8,275 sentences and 167,739 words. In contrast, Answer B discusses a different aspect of corpus size, mentioning that a 20-million token corpus is too small for a specific task related to ELMo models. The two answers address different contexts and do not convey the same information about the corpus size, making them semantically non-equivalent."
Which methods are considered to find examples of biases and unwarranted inferences??,"spot patterns by just looking at a collection of images, tag all descriptions with part-of-speech information, I applied Louvain clusteringLooking for adjectives marking the noun ""baby"" and also looking for most-common adjectives related to certain nouns using POS-tagging",Unwarranted inferences and stereotype-driven biases.,0,"Answer A provides a detailed methodology for identifying biases and unwarranted inferences through specific techniques such as pattern recognition in images, tagging descriptions, and using clustering and part-of-speech tagging. In contrast, Answer B simply states 'unwarranted inferences and stereotype-driven biases' without elaboration on methods. While both answers relate to the topic of biases and inferences, Answer A describes methods to find them, whereas Answer B lists types of biases. Therefore, they are not semantically equivalent as they address different aspects of the query."
What factors control the reliance of artificial organisms on plasticity?,Environmental fluctuation and uncertainty control the reliance of artificial organisms on plasticity.,"Environment fluctuation and uncertainty control the reliance on plasticity, while the form of the emerging plasticity rule is determined by details of the task.",0,"Answer A identifies 'environmental fluctuation and uncertainty' as the controlling factors for the reliance of artificial organisms on plasticity. Answer B also mentions these factors but adds that the 'form of the emerging plasticity rule' is influenced by task details. While both answers discuss the same primary factors, Answer B provides additional information about task details affecting plasticity, which makes it broader in scope. Therefore, the two answers are not semantically equivalent as Answer B introduces new elements not present in Answer A."
What is the benchmark dataset and is its quality high?,"Social Honeypot dataset (public) and Weibo dataset (self-collected); yesSocial Honeypot, which is not of high quality",The benchmark dataset is the one billion word language modeling benchmark dataset BIBREF21. The quality of this dataset is high.,0,"Answer A identifies the benchmark datasets as the Social Honeypot dataset and the Weibo dataset, stating that the quality of the Social Honeypot dataset is not high. Answer B, on the other hand, refers to a different benchmark dataset, the one billion word language modeling benchmark dataset BIBREF21, and asserts that its quality is high. Since the two answers refer to different datasets and provide opposing assessments of quality, they are not semantically equivalent."
