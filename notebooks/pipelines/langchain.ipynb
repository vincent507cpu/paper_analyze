In Fortran, parameters are always passed by reference, making it relatively easy to generate the code. However, in languages like Pascal, parameters can be passed by different methods chosen by the programmer (by reference, by value, or by \\\"name\\\"). This information is only known at the procedure's definition, which may not be encountered before its invocation. To address this issue, a special construction called a \\\"forward\\\" declaration is introduced in Pascal. This allows the compiler to know the parameter's usage before its full definition, enabling code generation without the need for a messy fixup mechanism or multiple passes through the source code.\":\n",

The game was co-developed by Nintendo and the American visual technology group Paradigm Simulation. It was one of three launch titles for the Nintendo 64 in Japan as well as Europe and one of two launch titles in North America. Pilotwings 64 is a follow-up to Pilotwings for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), which was a North American launch game for its respective console in 1991.
